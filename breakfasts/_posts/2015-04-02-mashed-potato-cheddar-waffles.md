#### Ingredients:

* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
* ¼ cup buttermilk
* 2 large eggs
* 2 cups mashed potatoes
* 3 tablespoons chopped chives
* ½ cup all-purpose flour
* ½ teaspoon baking powder
* ¼ teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ½ teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
* ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 cup grated cheddar cheese

#### Directions:

1. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.  As the butter melts it will begin to crackle and pop.  That’s the water evaporating out of the butter.  
2. Continue to cook the butter until the crackling subsides and the butter begins to brown a bit.  The butter will smell nutty.  
3. Immediately transfer the browned butter into a medium bowl. 
4. Whisk in buttermilk and eggs until thoroughly combined.  
5. Add the mashed potatoes and 2 tablespoons chives and gently stir to combine.
6. In a small bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  
7. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients.  Use a spoon to mix until all of the flour is thoroughly combined.  Try not to overmix the batter.  Just stir it until the flour is combined.
8. Heat a waffle iron and grease if necessary.
9. Dollop batter (about ¼ cup per waffle) into the waffle iron.  Cook until golden on each side.  The amount of time depends on your waffle iron.  
10. Remove waffles from  the iron and place on a cooling rack to rest.  The cooling rack will keep the waffles from getting soggy on the bottom as they cool.
11. Just before serving the waffles, turn oven to the broiler setting.  Place waffles on a baking sheet and top with cheddar cheese.  
12. Place waffles under the broiler until cheese is melted, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Remove from the oven, sprinkle with remaining chives and serve warm (with salsa is delicious!).
