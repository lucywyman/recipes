#### Ingredients:

* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* ⅓ cup granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 1⅓ to 1½ cups heavy cream plus more for brushing the top
* ¾ cup coarsely chopped fresh strawberries
* ⅓ cup chopped white chocolate (optional)
* sugar for topping

#### Directions:

1. Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with a Silpat or parchment paper and set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.  Set aside.
3. In a liquid measuring cup mix together vanilla extract and 1 ⅓ cups cream. 
4. Drizzle the cream mixture into the dry ingredients tossing and stirring as you pour in the cream (I ended up needing to add an extra 2 tablespoons of cream)
5. Add the strawberry chunks and white chocolate chunks (if using). Toss together. Add 2 more tablespoons of cream if necessary to create a moist, cohesive, but not sticky dough.
6. Dump the dough onto a lightly floured work surface.  Gently gather and knead the dough into a dish and press the disk out into a ¾"-thickness.
7. Use a small biscuit cutter to cut small 1 ¼-inch circles from the dough disk.  
8. Brush each circle with heave cream and sprinkle generously with sugar.
9. Place 1-inch apart on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 12 to 14 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through.

Remove from the oven and serve warm.
