-----------

1. Heat a large pot over medium heat. Add the oil, scallions, garlic and tomato to the pot, season with salt and pepper. 
2. Cook stirring until soft, about 10 minutes. 
3. Stir in ¼ cup cilantro, cumin and cook 1 minute more.
4. Add the lentils, potato, broth and bay leaf. 
5. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat to medium low, cover and cook until the lentils become tender about 30 minutes.
6. Remove the bay leaf, and puree the soup in the blender in 2 batches (so it doesn't explode) until very smooth. 
7. Adjust soup with salt and pepper to taste, then ladle into bowls and top with sour cream, scallions and cilantro, if desired; serve immediately.
