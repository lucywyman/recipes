* 1 tsp minced garlic
* ¼ cup (15 g) fresh chopped parsley (or other herb of choice)
* ½ cup (83 g) corn (if canned, very well drained)

#### Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C) and arrange a rack in the center of the oven. Generously grease a standard muffin tin with oil of choice.
2. Add finely grated potatoes to a large mixing bowl with garlic, parsley, corn, butter, cornstarch, salt and pepper and stir to thoroughly combine.
3. Divide mixture evenly between 12 muffin tins, filling each tin with about ¼ cup of the potato mixture. Press down gently to form. Sprinkle the tops with a pinch more salt and pepper
4. Bake for 20 minutes.
5. At the 20-minute mark, increase oven temperature to 425°F (218°C) and bake for 10-12 minutes more, or until the tops appear golden brown.
6. Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes, then loosen the sides with a butter knife and gently lift out with a fork. 
7. Serve immediately as is or with hot sauce. 

Notes: Best when fresh. To freeze, arrange baked haystacks in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze until firm. Then store in a freezer-safe container up to 3-4 weeks. Reheat in the microwave, or a 350°F (176°C) oven until completely warmed through.
