##### Ingredients:

* 1 large bunch kale (about 10 ounces)
* 4 cups warmed chicken or vegetablespoon stock, divided

##### Directions:

1. Wash the kale and remove the bottom inch of stem. Chop roughly into 1-inch pieces.
2. Add 1 tsp of olive oil to a large saucepan and heat on medium heat
3. Add the kale and salt and stir to coat with oil.
4. Cook, stirring, until the kale begins to wilt, about 5 minutes. 
5. Add 2 cups chicken stock, lower heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes.
6. Transfer the mixture to a blender. (Fill the blender no more than halfway; puree in two batches if necessary.) 
7. Puree, starting on the lowest speed, until smooth. Puree the second batch if necessary. Pour into a large bowl and set aside.
8. In the same skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tsp olive oil and cook the onions with the salt until the onions just barely show color, stirring for about 3 minutes. 
9. Add the chopped apples and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until the apples soften and onions are translucent. Stir in the remaining broth.
10. Transfer the mixture to the blender, splitting into two batches if necessary. Puree until smooth.
11. Combine the pureed apple and onion mixture with the kale mixture, and whisk to combine. If soup seems too thick, add more stock or water until it reaches the desired consistency.
12. Reheat if necessary, and serve garnished with a dollop of crème fraîche, mascarpone cheese, or plain yogurt and a few grinds of black pepper.
