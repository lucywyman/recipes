##### Ingredients:

* 2¼ cups pumpkin puree (about 1 small can or ½ large can)
* 1 carrot, cut into thin rounds

* 1 cup canned coconut milk

* 2 large ears corn
* 1 bag of shrimp (size?)

##### Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 450°F
2. Peel the husk and silk from the corn, dice the potatoes, chop the carrot and onion, and peel + devein the shrimp if they aren't already
3. Coat the corn cob with coconut oil, and coat the potatoes in olive oil (or any oil really), then spread on a baking sheet and roast for 20-25 minutes, turning the corn halfway through.
4. To a large saucepan over medium heat add 1 Tbsp olive oil, onion, carrot, and garlic. Cook for 5-7 minutes, until the onion starts to become translucent.
5. Add pumpkin, broth, coconut milk, and spices, and bring to simmer
6. Transfer soup mixture to a blender or use an immersion blender to puree the soup. Pour mixture back into pot.
7. Continue cooking over medium-low heat for 5-10 minutes and taste and adjust seasonings as needed. 
8. In a small saucepan, place 1 tbsp of olive oil and the shrimp. 
9. Cook the shrimp for 7-10 minutes, until pink and starting to crisp
10. Remove the corn and potatoes from the oven. Put the potatoes directly into the soup, then remove the corn kernels from the cob (I just slice them off with a knife) and add to the soup
11. Lastly pour the shrimp and any crispy bits into the soup. Give it a good stir
12. Garnish with rosemary, pumpkin seeds, sour cream, or crunchy bread. Enjoy!
