6. Fold in the nuts and chocolate.
7. Using an electric mixer beat the egg whites until stiff. 
8. Fold 1/3 of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it up. Fold through the remaining egg whites.
9. Pour batter into cake pan and bake for 40 to 50 minutes. 
10. Cool for 15 minutes before turning it out onto a platter.
11. To serve: Melt chocolate in the microwave, about 2-3 minutes, taking it out after each minute and stirring. 
12. Pour melted chocolate over the cake and using an offset spatula spread the chocolate evenly over the top of the cake. Cut the cake into slices before the chocolate sets.
