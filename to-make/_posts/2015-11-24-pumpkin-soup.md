#### Ingredients:

* 2¼ cups pumpkin puree

#### Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. To a large saucepan over medium heat add 1 Tbsp olive oil, shallot and garlic. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until slightly browned and translucent. Turn down heat if cooking too quickly.
3. Add remaining ingredients, including the pumpkin, and bring to a simmer.
4. Transfer soup mixture to a blender or use an emulsion blender to puree the soup. If using a blender, place a towel over the top of the lid before mixing to avoid any accidents. Pour mixture back into pot.
5. Continue cooking over medium-low heat for 5-10 minutes and taste and adjust seasonings as needed.
