##### Ingredients:

* ¾ cup water 
* ¼ cup Bob's Red Mill 7 Grain Hot Cereal (I also used steel cut oatmeal with great success)
* ¼ teaspoon orange rind, finely grated (I used orange peel from the spice rack, with great success)
* 1 dash kosher salt 
* 1 dash ground cinnamon 
* 1 pinch fresh ground nutmeg 
* 4-5 tablespoons milk of choice
* 2 drops vanilla extract 
* 1 teaspoon butter 
* 1 tablespoon maple syrup

##### Directions:

1. In a small pot, add orange rind to water and bring to a boil.
2. Add cereal, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg and reduce heat. 
3. Stir while cooking and add the soy milk a tablespoon at a time when liquid has been fully absorbed by the cereal.
4. When the cereal is done, about 6 minutes, add vanilla extract, butter, and maple syrup. 
5. Stir to mix and serve hot.
