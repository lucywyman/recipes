##### Directions:

###### To make the crust

1. Stir the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and salt together in a medium bowl. 
2. Pour over the melted butter and stir until all of the dry ingredients are uniformly moist.  I use my fingers!  
3. Turn the ingredients into a 9-inch pie pan and pat with your fingers to create an even layer of crumbs of the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan.
4. Put the pan in the freezer while you preheat the oven.
5. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Once heated, place the pie crust on the center rack of the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes. Remove from oven and set crust aside to cool.

###### To make the peanut butter

1. Once the crust has cooled, spread the peanut butter over the bottom of the crust in a thick layer.

###### To prepare the banana filling

1. Combine granulated sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a bowl. 
2. Add egg yolks, and whisk until smooth. 
3. Bring milk to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. 
4. Add 1/2 cup milk to yolk mixture in a slow, steady stream, whisking constantly. 
5. Pour mixture into pan with hot milk, and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture begins to bubble and is very thick, about 6 minutes. Make sure to keep an eye on this and whisk constantly over a low flame. The cornstarch will make the mixture thicken quickly.
6. Pour milk mixture through a large-mesh sieve into a bowl. 
7. Add butter, and stir until melted. 
8. Fold in bananas. 
9. Pour into crust, on top of the peanut butter
10. Place plastic wrap directly on surface of filling to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate for 2 hours.

###### To make the bacon

1. Coarsely chop the bacon
2. Place in a pan over medium-high heat and cook until crispy
