#### Ingredients:

* 1 bunch asparagus of reasonable size, also chopped

#### Directions:

1. First, chop chicken and asparagus
2. Fry chicken and asparagus in olive oil with spices (we use a wok, cause there's a lot of chicken). They take roughly the same time to cook, so we put them in together.
3. Meanwhile, bring about 5 quarts of water to boil, and cook pasta
4. Drain pasta, and add chicken-asparagus mixture once finished.
5. Stir in cream and parmesan
6. Enjoy
