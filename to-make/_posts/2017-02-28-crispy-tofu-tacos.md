#### Directions:

    Drain and rinse tofu and then press it by placing between two
kitchen towels and topping with a heavy book. Allow to sit for at
least 30 minutes so that excess moisture is drawn out. Alternatively,
you can accomplish this by using a tofu press.
    Next preheat the oven to 400°F and then line a baking sheet with
parchment paper. Begin preparing the slaw by combining the cabbage
with the vinegar and salt in a large bowl. Massage it with your hands
for a few minutes then set it aside to marinate.
    Once the tofu has been pressed, dice it into 1-inch cubes and then
transfer to the baking sheet. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes on each
side until it’s light golden brown. Then turn the oven off and set
tofu aside to cool.
    Meanwhile mix together the spices (paprika to pepper) in a large
bowl. Using your hands, lightly coat the tofu with one tablespoon of
oil and then transfer it to the bowl with the spices. Coat each piece
evenly then sprinkle the starch on top. Mix with your hands or a spoon
until each piece is coated with the starch as well.
    Warm the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a skillet over medium
heat and then saute the tofu on for about 5 minutes on each side.
Depending on the size of your skillet, you might have to do this part
in two steps, using one tablespoon of oil at a time.
    Allow the tofu to sit in the skillet on warm then prepare the
avocado crema by placing all of the ingredients in a food processor
and blending until smooth.
    Warm the tortillas (I usually microwave them for 15-20 seconds)
then place tofu inside. Top with cabbage and avocado cream and serve
immediately.
    Tofu and cabbage can be made ahead of time and stored in an
airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. The avocado crema
can be stored for up to 2 days.
