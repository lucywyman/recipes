* 4 large eggs, at room temperature

##### Directions:

###### For the Rhubarb:

1. Cut rhubarb stalks to fit crosswise inside the top of a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan. You’ll need enough rhubarb to cover the top of the cake in the loaf pan.
2. In a medium pot combine sugar, 1 cup water and the vanilla, and bring to a boil. 
3. Simmer until the sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. 
4. Stir in rhubarb, simmer for 1 minute, then remove from heat. 
5. Cool to room temperature, then slice rhubarb in half lengthwise so you have long, thin pieces. Reserve poaching liquid.

###### For the Cake:

1. Heat oven to 350°F, and butter and flour the loaf pan.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together milk, vanilla extract and vanilla.
4. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy. 
5. Beat in eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl between each addition. 
6. Beat in half the flour mixture until just combined, then beat in milk mixture until barely combined, scraping the sides of the bowl. 
7. Beat in remaining flour mixture until just combined.
8. Scrape half the batter into prepared pan, then lay half of the rhubarb slices in an even layer on top of the batter. 
9. Cover with remaining batter, smoothing the top.
10. Bake cake for 20 minutes to set the top, then remove pan from the oven and quickly lay the remaining rhubarb slices next to each other on the top of cake. 
11. Return pan to oven and bake until a toothpick inserted in the cake's center comes out clean, another 30 to 50 minutes.
12. While cake is baking, bring rhubarb-poaching liquid to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer; continue to simmer until thickened and syrupy, about 10 minutes. 
13. Brush some syrup on top of cake once it comes out of the oven.

Let cake cool in pan on a wire rack before serving, at least 2 hours, then carefully remove the cake from the pan and serve
