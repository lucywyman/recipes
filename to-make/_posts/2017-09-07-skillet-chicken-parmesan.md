##### Ingredients:

* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 2 small boneless, skinless chicken breasts, patted dry
* Salt and pepper
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* Large pinch of crushed red pepper flakes
* ¼ tsp dried oregano
* 1 14 oz can crushed tomatoes
* 1 cups shredded packaged mozzarella or sliced fresh mozzarella, patted dry
* Freshly grated Parmesan or Pecorino cheese (optional)
* Handful of fresh basil leaves (optional)

##### Directions:

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F, with a rack in the middle position. 
2. In a large high-sided sauté pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat until it shimmers. 
3. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper, add to the pan, and cook until lightly golden, about 2 minutes. 
4. Flip the pieces over and cook 1 minute more.
5. Sprinkle the garlic around the chicken, followed by the pepper flakes and oregano. 
6. Pour the tomatoes evenly over the chicken, season with salt and pepper, then gently shake the pan to distribute the sauce (you can also do this with a small spoon). Top the chicken with the mozzarella and Parmesan (if using) to taste.
7. Bake until the sauce is bubbling and the chicken is just cooked through, about 12 to 14 minutes. (Brown it under the broiler, if you like.) 
8. Once it’s off the heat, top with the basil leaves (if using), tearing any large ones. 
9. Let the chicken rest for about 5 minutes before serving and keep the pan’s handle covered with an oven mitt; it’s easy to forget it’s hot. Serve with more Parmesan cheese, if you like.

**Note**: If you want to make the recipe ahead of time, skip preheating the oven and refrigerate the dish after adding cheese (covered, for up to one day). Let sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes before baking, uncovered. We prefer to do this rather than reheating the finished dish because chicken breasts dry out very easily.
