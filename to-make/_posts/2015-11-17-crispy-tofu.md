#### Ingredients:

#### #Tofu Marinade:

    14 oz extra firm or firm tofu, pressed
    1 tbsp low sodium tamari/soy sauce
    2 tbsp ketchup
    1 tsp maple syrup or other sweetener
    ½ tsp hot sauce (optional)
    2 tsp oil
    ½ tsp garam masala ( or ½ tsp ground cumin and ½ tsp ground coriander)
    ½ tsp garlic

    ¼ tsp salt

<br>

#### Directions:

1. Slice the slab into 6 to 8 rectangles. Press the tofu for half an hour between kitchen towels and under a heavy weight to remove excess moisture. or use Tofu press (before or after slicing).
2. Mix the marinade ingredients. Dip the tofu in the marinade and coat all sides to make an even coating that is not too thick or too thin. Place the tofu strips in a container with a lid.
3. Refrigerate for atleast half an hour or longer.
4. Mix everything under breadcrumb coating. If the breadcrumbs are too large, pulse them a few times in a blender and use.
5. Place each tofu strip in the breadcrumb mixture. Flip to coat all sides
6. Heat a grill pan over medium high heat. Brush oil on the pan and place the breaded tofu on the pan. Cook 7 yo 9 minutes each side or until brown strips appear.
7. To bake: Bake at preheated 425° F for 30 minutes or longer until crisp, flipping half way through.
8. Serve with sauces of choice like vegan ranch or a dash of lemon, or slice and to salads, bowls, wraps, sandwiches, etc.
