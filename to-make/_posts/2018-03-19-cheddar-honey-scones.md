##### Directions:

1. Preheat the oven to 425°F.
2. In large bowl combine the flour, salt, pepper, baking powder and soda. 
3. Using your fingers, a fork or a pastry blender, cut in butter until it forms coarse crumbs. 
4. Stir in the grated cheddar cheese. 
5. Stir in the buttermilk and honey. 
6. Stir with a spoon until a dough forms, using your hands to bring it together. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently.
7. Divide the dough in half or in thirds and pat each into 5-inch round circles. 
8. Brush each scone with melted butter and top another crack of black pepper. 
9. Cut each round into 4 or 6 slices, or use a biscuit cutter to make rounds. 
10. Bake the scones for 12 to 14 minutes, until the tops are slightly golden. Drizzle with honey if desired. Serve immediately.
