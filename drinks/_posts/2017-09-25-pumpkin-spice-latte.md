That's right, we're going there. It's officially fall, and for those who like me don't want to consume [50+ grams of sugar]() you can make your own PSL at home!

##### Ingredients:

* 2 tablespoonspoons canned pumpkin
* 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
* 1 tablespoonspoon maple syrup (or sweetener of choice. Sugar, honey, agave, dates, all work!)
* 1 cup milk of choice
* 1 to 2 shots espresso, about Â¼ cup, or 8 oz extra strong coffee
* 1 teaspoon coconut oil (optional)
* Whipped cream (optional)

##### Directions:

1. **Heat the pumpkin and spices**: I like to do this by mixing the pumpkin and spices in a small microwave safe bowl and microwaving for 1 minute. You can also do it in a saucepan on the stove.
2. **Stir in the sugar**: Add the sugar and stir until the mixture looks like a bubbly thick syrup.
3. **Warm the milk**: I usually just heat the milk in it's own saucepan. You can also mix it into the pumpkin and spices if you're already using a saucepan for that.
4. **Blend**: Add everything to a blender and blend on medium-low for 1-2 minutes, until the mixture is frothy. 

Serve! Top with whipped cream and extra spices if you'd like, or just enjoy as-is.
