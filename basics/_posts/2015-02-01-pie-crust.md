#### Ingredients:

* 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
* ¼ teaspoon fine salt
* 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
* 8 tablespoons cold unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into small pieces
* 4 to 5 tablespoons ice water

<br>

#### Directions:

1. Combine the flour, salt, and sugar in a large bowl and stir briefly
2. Using a pastry blender or your fingers, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until it’s in pea-size pieces that are slightly yellow in color, about 4 to 5 minutes.
3. Drizzle in 5 tablespoons of the ice water and mix just until the dough comes together. (Add the last tablespoon of ice water if necessary, but don’t overwork the dough or it’ll become tough.)
4. Shape the dough into a flat disk, cover it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, then use it in the pie or tart recipe of your choice!
