#### Ingredients:

* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, room temperature for brushing baking dish
* ½ cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar, divided
* 1 teaspoon orange zest
* ½ teaspoon fresh grated nutmeg
* 6 large eggs, at room temperature, separated
* 6 ounces semi sweet dark chocolate (about 63%), melted
* ½ teaspoon salt
* powdered sugar for dusting
* lightly sweetened whipped cream for serving

#### Directions:

1. Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat oven to 350°F.
2. Lightly brush a 2-quart baking dish with butter and dust the bottom and sides with granulated sugar. Set aside.
3. In a medium bowl stir together ½ cup granulated sugar and orange zest. 
4. Stir until the zest is evenly distributed through the sugar and the sugar is lightly tinted orange and fragrant. Stir in the nutmeg. 
5. Add the egg yolks to the orange sugar and whisk vigorously, until the mixture is pale yellow and thickened slightly. I just did this with a whisk by hand for about 5 minutes.
6. Stir in the melted chocolate and set aside. The mixture may thicken some after the chocolate is added. That's alright.
7. In a bowl with a hand mixer, beat eggs at medium speed until frothy and beginning to thicken. Sprinkle in the salt and continue to beat to soft peaks. The egg whites should just hold a point on the whisk attachment. If you beat the egg whites too stiff, they'll be hard to incorporate into the egg and chocolate mixture.
8. Spoon about ⅓ of the egg white mixture into the chocolate mixture and fold until just incorporated. Continue in two more batches until the egg whites are well incorporated into the chocolate, the chocolate has lightened and puffed, but try not to over mix the chocolate and egg.
9. Pour into prepared baking dish and bake for 23-25 minutes until puffed and the center barely jiggles when shaken lightly.
10. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes before dusting with powdered sugar and serving warm.
11. Cake will last, well wrapped at room temperature for up to 3 days.
