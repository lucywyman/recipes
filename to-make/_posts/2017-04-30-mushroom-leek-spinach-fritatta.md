#### Ingredients:

* 2 medium leeks
* 6 large eggs
* 1 tablespoon full-fat coconut milk
* 2 teaspoons fresh chopped thyme

#### Directions:

1. Slice and chop all vegetables
2. Trim leeks, cut in half lengthwise, then cut into ¼ inch thick
pieces. Rinse well with cold water and set aside
3. Preheat the broiler (or oven to 500°F).
4. In a medium bowl combine the eggs, coconut milk, thyme, salt, and
red pepper flakes. Set aside.
5. Heat the olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. 
6. Add the leeks and mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until
soft, 5-8 minutes.
7. Add the spinach and garlic and let the spinach wilt for 30 seconds.
8. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and cook over medium heat.
9. As the egg mixture sets, run a spatula around the edge of the
skillet, lifting the cooked egg so the uncooked egg flows underneath.
Cook until the egg is beginning to set.
10. Transfer the pan to the oven and broil 4-5 minutes, until the top
is set and lightly brown.
11. Top with green onions, cut into wedges, and serve hot!
