##### Ingredients:

* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup cake flour
* ¼ cup granulated sugar
* 1 ½ tsp baking soda
* 1 ½ tsp cream of tartar
* 1 tsp salt
* 4 tbsp unsalted butter, softened
* 1 ¼ cups buttermilk
* 1 egg, lightly beaten
* 1 tbsp caraway seeds (optional)
* 2 tbsp butter, melted (for brushing)

##### Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 400° F and position rack in upper-middle position. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat (or lightly grease).
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flours, sugar, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt. 
3. Work the softened butter into the dry ingredients using a pastry blender or a fork or your hands until the flour mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
4. Add the buttermilk, egg and caraway seeds and stir with a fork just until the dough begins to come together. 
5. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead gently just until the dough is cohesive. It should be bumpy - overworking it will cause the resulting scones to be tough instead of tender and flaky.
6. Divide the dough evenly into 8 pieces and pat each into a round shape. 
7. Using a sharp knife, cut a cross shape into the top of each scone. 
8. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes. The scones should be golden brown and a thin knife or skewer should come out clean. 
9. Remove from the oven and immediately brush with the melted butter. Allow to cool to room temperature.
