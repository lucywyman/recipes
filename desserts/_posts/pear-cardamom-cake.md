* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* ½ tsp ground cardamom
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* ½ cup canola oil
* 1 large egg

##### Directions:

###### Cake:

1. Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F). Grease and flour two 5-inch (12-13 cm) cake pans.
2. In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, cardamom and sugar. Set aside.
3. In another bowl, whisk together oil, egg, egg yolk and sour cream.
4. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until smooth. Add the grated pear.
5. Divide the batter between the cake pans. Bake for 35-40 minutes (if you're using a 6-inch pan, start checking around 30 minutes) or until a cake tester comes out clean.
6. Let cool for 15 minutes before removing the cakes from the pans to cool completely.

###### Frosting:

1. Place butter in a small saucepan on medium heat and stir until it melts completely.
2. Continue cooking, stirring frequently until the milk solids turn brown and the butter smells nutty, about 5-10 minuter longer. Take care not to burn (it will continue to brown even after you remove it from the heat, so take it off early).
3. Scrape the melted butter and browned bits into a small bowl and chill until almost solidified but still soft enough to be beaten with an electric mixer (about 20-30 minutes in the freezer, an hour or so in the fridge).
4. Put the butter in a mixing bowl and beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
5. Add the powdered sugar, cardamom and salt and beat until completely smooth and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes. Beat in the cream until frosting is fluffy.

###### Assembly:

1. If cakes are rounded on top, even out with a knife. 
2. Cut both cakes in half using a sharp serrated knife (you'll end up with four layers). 
Put the first layer on a cake board or a cake stand. Spread frosting on the first layer. Add the next layer and repeat until you've used up all four layers
