#### Directions:

Preheat oven to 425°F
Make the herb paste - Place herbs, parsley, garlic (yes, all 10!), salt, pepper and lemon zest in a food processor and pulse until it becomes very coarse. Add oil and scrape down the sides if necessary, pulse until just combined. 
Rub paste on your pork. I chose to just cover the top and sides, leaving the bottom of the pork clean. Place pork on a pan.
Prep your potatoes - Place halved new potatoes in a bowl and toss with a drizzle of olive oil until coated.
Place potatoes on a baking sheet and sprinkle with salt & pepper. Line asparagus on a smaller baking sheet, brush with olive oil and sprinkle with salt & pepper.
Place pork, potatoes, & asparagus in oven at the same time (I moved two racks as close to the center as possible, placed pork on the bottom and veggies on the top). Roast the pork for 30-40 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 140°F. Cover pork with foil and let sit for about 15 minutes before cutting. Cook potatoes until they are easily pierced with a fork (30-35 minutes). When potatoes are done, toss them in lemon juice. 
While everything is cooking, make the white wine sauce. Heat olive oil in a medium sized skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant. Add lemon juice and white wine and increase the heat to medium-high. Simmer until liquid has reduced by half (about 5 minutes). Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Add 2 tablespoons of water along with the butter and turn off the heat once it is melted. Stir to combine.
Cut your pork loin into 1/2 inch slices. To assemble your plates, place about 4 slices of porkloin and generous portions of potatoes and asparagus on each plate. Top the pork with a spoonful of the garlic, wine sauce and ENJOY!
