##### Ingredients:

###### Cake

* ½ cup virgin coconut oil, melted, plus more for pans
* 3 cups almond flour, plus more for dusting pans
* 1½ tsp. kosher salt
* 1 tsp. baking powder
* 1 tsp. ground cardamom
* 1 tsp. ground cinnamon
* 1 tsp. ground ginger
* ½ tsp. baking soda
* 5 large eggs
* 1¼ cups (packed) dark brown sugar
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract
* 10 oz. carrots, peeled, coarsely shredded, squeezed firmly to expel excess water

Optional:
* ¾ cup shredded unsweetened coconut
* ¾ cup walnuts, finely chopped
* ½ cup golden raisins

###### Frosting and Assembly

* 8 oz. cream cheese, room temperature
* ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature

##### Directions:

###### Cake

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease two 8" parchment-lined round cake pans with oil, then dust with almond flour, tapping out excess.
2. Whisk salt, baking powder, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, baking soda, and remaining 3 cups flour in a medium bowl.
3. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat eggs and brown sugar in a large bowl until more than tripled in volume and mixture holds a ribbon for several seconds when drizzled over itself, 5–7 minutes. (Beating the eggs thoroughly in this stage goes a long way toward creating an aerated, light crumb, which is critical when using gluten-free ingredients.) Beat in vanilla.
4. Toss carrots, coconut, walnuts, raisins, and remaining ½ cup oil in another medium bowl.
5. Reduce mixer speed to low. 
6. Add flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with carrot mixture in 3 additions, to egg mixture, beating well after each addition.
7. Divide batter between prepared pans. 
8. Bake cake until lightly browned across the top, a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, and the top springs back when gently poked, 33–36 minutes. 
9. Let cool 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around edges of pans to release cake, then invert onto a wire rack. Let cool completely.

###### Frosting and Assembly

1. Using electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat cream cheese and butter in a large bowl, scraping down as needed, until very smooth, about 2 minutes. 
2. Reduce mixer speed to low and add powdered sugar. Beat until combined. 
3. Add yogurt, vanilla, and salt and increase speed to medium-high. 
4. Beat, scraping down occasionally, until light and airy, about 4 minutes. 
5. Chill 10 minutes if needed to stiffen slightly to a spreadable consistently.
6. Arrange one cake round domed side down on a large plate or platter. Cover top and sides with one-third of frosting. 
7. Top with remaining cake layer, domed side up. Coat top and sides with remaining frosting.
