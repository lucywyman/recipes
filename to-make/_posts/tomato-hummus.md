* ¼ medium red onion, chopped small

##### Directions:

###### For the Hummus
1. Peel your chickpeas. "I find this is easiest when you take a chickpea between your thumb and next two fingers, arranging the pointy end in towards your palm, and “pop!” the naked chickpea out. Discard the skin." I find this dreadful and make others do it.
2. In a food processor, blend the chickpeas until powdery clumps form, a full minute, scraping down the sides. 
3. Add the tahini, lemon juice, garlic and salt and blend until pureed. 
4. With the machine running drizzle in chickpea cooking water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you get very smooth, light and creamy mixture. I find I need about 4 tablespoons for this volume, but you may need slightly more or less.
5. Taste and adjust seasonings, adding more salt or lemon if needed. 
6. Transfer the hummus to a bowl and rest it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.

###### To Serve

1. Spread hummus on a large plate with the back of a spoon, creating swirls and cavities.
2. Mix tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, lemon, about 1½ tablespoons olive oil, plus salt and pepper to taste in a bowl. 
3. If you have sumac, add about ¼ teaspoon. 
4. Stir in herbs. 
5. Heap salad on hummus, arrange pita wedges all around. 

Finish with additional za’atar, sumac, and/or fresh herbs and enjoy with good company!
