##### Ingredients:

* Cooking spray
* 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar (12 ounces)
* 1/2 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder
* 1/2 cup black cocoa powder
* 1 teaspoon espresso powder
* 1/2 teaspoon fine salt
* 3 large egg whites
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 cups dark chocolate chips

##### Directions:

1. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, and cut or prepare a third sheet of parchment. Spray each sheet of parchment with cooking spray — this may seem redundant, but these cookies are extremely sticky and this step will guarantee no stuck cookies.
2. Place the powdered sugar, Dutch cocoa, black cocoa, espresso powder, and salt in a large bowl and whisk until mostly homogenous; some lumps are okay.
3. Add the egg whites and vanilla and then beat them into the dry ingredients. A hand mixer on low speed does this best, but a wooden spoon and some arm strength works too.
4. Add the chocolate chips and use a spoon or spatula to fold into the batter.
5. Scoop the dough into tablespoon-sized balls and place them evenly on the parchment sheets, 12 per sheet. 
6. Set aside for at least 30 minutes while the oven preheats.
7. Preheat the oven to 350°F and bake the cookies. 
8. Bake! The cookies are done when they've spread and are shiny and cracked, 8 to 10 minutes.
9. Place the baking sheets on a wire rack to cool for 1 minute. Carefully slide the parchment paper with the cookies still on them onto the rack.

Enjoy!
