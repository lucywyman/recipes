##### Ingredients:

* 1 ears worth of corn
* 1 small chicken breast, cooked and diced

* 1/2 teaspoon pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* a dash of chili powder

##### Directions:

A note about avocados: Since I cook for 1 person, this salad made for
about 3-4 meals over the course of 2-3 days. Since avocado doesn't do
so well in the fridge, I made the rest of the salad on it's own and
would dice ~Â½ an avocado over each serving right before eating it,
then wrap the avocado and store it in the fridge for up to a day. This
worked well for me, but if you're serving a family of 4 and will eat
most of the salad in one sitting, go ahead and throw in as much
avocado as you please!

A note about dressing: I know that this salad should have some kind of
lime-dressing, or maybe a creamy avocado-ranch kind of thing, but to
be perfectly honest I don't like dressing on my salads, especially if
they are hanging out in the fridge for a few days. Sorry not sorry.

1. Chop the veggies and cook the chicken
2. Whisk the salt, pepper, and spice into the olive oil
3. Toss everything in the dressing
