#### Ingredients:

<br>

#### Directions:

1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Bring the coconut milk to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. 
3. Remove from heat and stir in the chocolate with a rubber spatula.
4. Once the chocolate mixture is smooth, add the raspberries 6-8 at a time. 
5. Use the spatula to stir the chocolate and coat the berries, then use 2 forks to remove each raspberry, transferring from one fork to the other to let the excess ganache drip off. 
6. Place the raspberries on the parchment paper and repeat until all the raspberries are coated.
7. Refrigerate the truffles until firm, about an hour, then place the cocoa powder in a zip-top bag. 
8. Put the truffles in the bag with the cocoa powder and toss to coat. Remove the truffles from the bag, shaking off any excess cocoa powder.
9. Return the truffles to the refrigerator until ready to serve, up to 2 days.
