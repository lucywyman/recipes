##### Ingredients:

* 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
* 1 ½ teaspoon ground ginger
* ¾ teaspoon ground cloves
* ¾ teaspoon kosher salt
* ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
* ½ teaspoon ground all-spice
* 1 cup unsalted butter (2 sticks), room temperature
* 1 cup light or dark brown sugar
* 1 large egg
* 4 tablespoons unsulfured molasses
* ⅓ cup diced crystallized ginger (optional)
* 2 tablespoons turbinado sugar (optional)

##### Directions:

1. In a medium bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, salt, nutmeg and all-spice.
2. To a large bowl, add the room temperature butter and brown sugar. 
3. Using a stand-up mixer with the paddle attachment, cream the two together until the butter is light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. 
4. Add the egg and molasses and beat until combined, an additional minute.
5. In two batches, add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, combining in between batches. 
6. When you see no traces of flour, fold in the crystallized ginger, making sure it's evenly distributed throughout the dough (you might need to use your fingers because the ginger might stick together). 
7. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for 1 hour.
8. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.
9. Pour the turbinado sugar into a shallow plate. Using a 2-ounce ice cream scoop or 2 teaspoons, scoop out a ball of dough and roll it between your palms until it's an even 1½-inch circle. 
10. Roll the ball of dough in the turbinado, coating it evenly and then transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. 
11. Flatten the ball lightly with your fingers. (If you like, you can sprinkle a bit of additional sugar atop the cookie.) Repeat until you've gone through all of the dough (you may need to bake them in few batches). 
12. Bake for 11 minutes, until the edges are set but the center remains soft. 
13. Allow to cool on the baking sheet for an additional minute or so and then transfer to a rack to cool.
