title: Why I Chose to Make This Site Purely Static
---

1. **It's fast**. Since the only files being served are flat, and any
computation happens on the users end, the server's job is easy:
send the files.  This means the user doesn't have to wait for
lots of data to be sent for the page to update, and especially if
their connection is slow the site should still load quickly and work
well.
2. **It's scalable**. When all your server has to do is send files it
can handle more traffic than you can shake a stick at.
3. **It can be hosted anywhere**. No installations, databases, or chef
cookbooks required.
4. **I'm kind of lazy**.
