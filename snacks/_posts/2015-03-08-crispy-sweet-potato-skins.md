#### Ingredients:

* 3 yams or sweet potatoes
* oil or oil spray
* toppings of choice (We used parmesan cheese with great success. Other ideas are maple syrup, marshmallows, nuts, whipped cream, or butter)

<br>

#### Directions:

1. Poke a few holes around each potato with a fork. 
2. **If using the microwave**: wrap the potatoes loosely in paper towels and cook 14 minutes. 
3. **If using the oven**: Preheat oven to 400f place potatoes on a tray or baking dish, and bake for one hour. 
4. For both methods, once the potatoes are done, slice each in half lengthwise and scoop out about ⅔ of the flesh (save this scooped-out flesh). 
5. Preheat oven to 430 F, and either brush the skins with oil or spray with oil spray. 
6. Place on a baking sheet. Bake 15 minutes, then remove from the oven and re-stuff with filling.  If your topping is something like cheese, nuts, or marshmallows, add them now.
7. Place under the broiler, and broil (or bake at the oven’s highest temperature) 3-4 minutes.
