##### Ingredients:

* 3 oranges
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 375 grams all-purpose flour
* ½ teaspoon baking soda

##### Directions:

###### Bake the cake

1. Butter a deep, 9-inch round cake pan. Heat the oven to 325°F.
2. Finely grate the zest of the oranges into a bowl. 
3. Squeeze 3 tablespoons of juice from the oranges and add it to the zest. (Reserve remaining oranges for making glaze.) 
4. Stir in lemon juice and set aside.
5. In a separate bowl, sift together flour, baking soda and salt.
6. In a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream butter at medium speed until fluffy and light, 2 to 3 minutes. 
7. Add the sugar and beat to combine. 
8. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition.
9. At low speed, add a third of the dry ingredients and a third of the buttermilk, mixing until the batter is just combined. 
10. Repeat with remaining dry ingredients and buttermilk, adding in batches and mixing until just combined. 
11. Add the orange zest mixture and combine.
12. Pour batter into the prepared pan. 
13. Bake until just firm in the center and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean (a few crumbs are O.K.), about 1 to 1 ¼ hours.

###### Make the glaze: 

1. Stir the juices and sugar together until sugar dissolves.

###### Assembly:

1. When the cake is done, let cool in the pan for 15 minutes (it will still be warm). 
2. Turn out onto a wire rack set on a sheet pan with sides (run a knife around the edges if it sticks at first).
3. Use a baster or brush to spread a few spoonfuls of the glaze over the top. Let soak in before adding more. 
4. Continue until all the glaze is absorbed by the cake, including any that drips through onto the sheet pan. (Use your brush to pick it up from the pan and transfer back to the top of the cake.)


Let cool at room temperature. Eat immediately or wrap well in plastic and
refrigerate. Serve at room temperature or cold, in thin slices.
