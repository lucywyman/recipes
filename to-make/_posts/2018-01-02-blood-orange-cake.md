##### Directions:

###### Streusel
1. Whisk together the sugar, flour, cinnamon, cocoa, espresso powder and salt. 
2. Add the butter pieces and using your hands, mix together the flour and butter until the flour is incorporated and in tiny pieces. It’s okay if the mixture looks like sand!

###### Cake
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter and flour a 10-inch bundt cake pan and set aside. Butter and flour is KEY! Don’t use cooking spray.
2. Take the sugar and mix it with the orange zest. Rub it in between your fingers to combine fully.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, soda and salt. 
4. In the bowl of your electric mixer, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, then add the sugar and beat for 4 to 5 minutes on medium speed until fluffy, scraping down the sides if needed. 
5. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well for a minute or so after each addition. 
6. Add the vanilla and beat well. 
7. Beat in the yogurt, again scraping down the sides if needed.
8. Gradually add the dry ingredients with the mix on low speed. But until they are just incorporated. 
9. Spoon half of the batter into the greased bundt pan. 
10. Sprinkle the batter with two thirds of the streusel. 
11. Add the remaining batter on top then, swirl in the remaining streusel with a knife. 
12. Bake until a wooden pick inserted into the cake comes out clean, about 45 to 55 minutes.
13. Remove the cake from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Invert the pan on a wire rack and allow the cake to cool completely. Don’t attempt to move it or it will break apart!
14. Once cool, drizzle the cake with the blood orange glaze. Let set for about 30 minutes then slice and serve.
