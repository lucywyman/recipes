##### Ingredients:

* 1 (15oz) can chickpeas or white beans, with or without salt
* ⅓ cup honey or agave or ½ cup fine sugar 
* optional pinch cream of tartar, for stabilization
* feel free to add a little pure vanilla or almond extract

##### Directions:

1. Open the can of beans and drain just the watery part into a stand mixer or a large mixing bowl. Save the actual beans for a different recipe. If you need inspiration, here are [50+ Healthy Uses For Canned Beans](http://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/tag/beans/).) You should have about ½ cup chickpea liquid. 
2. Add all other ingredients, and beat with an electric mixer or in a stand mixer for 12-16 minutes. Mine only took about 5-6 minutes on high speed, but Katie's took closer to the full twelve, so be patient!
3. Cover and refrigerate any leftovers. It separates overnight, but re-beating works perfectly. 

Notes from Katie: (I’ve not tried this recipe without beaters, but you are free to experiment. The sugar version can be baked into meringues; I haven’t tried baking the liquid-sweetener version.) I’ve tried this with both regular and unsalted bean liquid and can’t taste a big difference, so use whatever you have on hand.
