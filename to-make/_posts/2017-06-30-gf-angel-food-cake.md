#### Ingredients:

* 12 large egg whites, room temperature
* 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* 1¼ teaspoons cream of tartar
* 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
* ¾ cup maple or coconut sugar
* 1 cup arrowroot flour

#### Directions:

1. Preheat the oven to 350ºF and adjust the rack to the middle position.
2. Place the egg whites and lemon juice in the bowl of a standing mixer. Whisk the egg mixture on medium-high until foamy, about 30 seconds. 
3. Add the salt, cream of tartar and vanilla. Whisk the mixture on medium-high until soft peaks form, about 1-2 minutes.
4. With the mixer on medium-high, slowly add ½ cup of the maple sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. 
5. Sift the remaining ¼ cup maple sugar and arrowroot flour into a small bowl. 
6. With the mixer on medium, slowly add the arrowroot mixture. 
7. Turn the speed up to medium-high and whip until smooth (there might be some tiny little lumps from the sugar, but it will melt in the oven while baking).
8. Pour the batter into a clean (and NOT oiled), 12-cup angel food cake pan. 
9. Bake for 40-45 minutes, until cake is puffed and the top is just turning golden brown.
10. Remove the cake from the oven. Let cool completely, about 1 hour. Run a knife around the outside of the cake and invert onto a cake platter (you might need to shake the cake a little to get it to separate from the center tube of the cake pan). 
11. Serve alone or with whipped cream and berries.
