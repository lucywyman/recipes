#### Ingredients:

* 1 tilapia filet
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 teaspoons garlic (optional)
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 4-6 grape or cherry tomatoes

#### Directions:

0. Diced the tomatoes. I use grape tomatoes, and like to slice them in half lengthwise then slice each length into thirds. 
1. Place the olive oil in the pan, and the fish in the olive oil. I like to rub the filet down a bit to make sure it's fully coated
2. Add salt, pepper, and garlic to both sides of the fish
3. Cook over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes, flipping after 5 minutes. The fish should turn a flaky golden brown and develop an almost-crust.
4. Once fully cooked, transfer to a plate. Cover with the diced tomatoes.

This simple but delicious meal has been a staple of my diet this summer. The fish fries *really* well, and the tomatoes cut the fattiness of the fried fish perfectly.
