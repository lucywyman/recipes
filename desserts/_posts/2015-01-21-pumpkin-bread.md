#### Directions:

1. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 350° F. 
2. Spray a 9x5 inch loaf pan with non-stick cooking spray. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, ginger, all spice, and nutmeg. 
4. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until it's combined and lightens in color just slightly.
5. Whisk in the pumpkin puree, oil, orange zest, vanilla extract, orange extract and apple cider.
6. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently mix together using a rubber spatula.
7. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Sprinkle the pepita seeds on top.
8. Bake the bread for 60-70 minutes
9. Insert a toothpick in the center to test is the bread is done, it should come out clean with only a few small moist crumbs.

We substitute a brown sugar crumble for pepita seeds.
