##### Ingredients:

* 1 cup chopped seeded tomato
* 1 small shallot, thinly sliced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tablespoonspoons EVOO
* 1 ½ teaspoons herbes de Provence
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* 2 halibut or cod fillets (5-6 ounces) (other fish work too!)
* 1/8 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 tablespoonspoon chopped fresh parsley

##### Directions:

1. Preheat the over to 425°F
2. Combine the tomato, shallot, garlic, 1 tablespoonspoon of the olive oil, herbes de Provence and 1/8 teaspoon of the salt in a medium bowl
3. Cut two 12x15" squares of parchment paper.
4. Rinse the fish and pat dry with towels. Place a fillet on each piece of parchment about 4" from the edge of the shorter sides. 
5. Sprinkle the fish with remaining salt and pepper. 
6. Spoon the tomato mixture on top of the fish and drizzle with remaining olive oil
7. Working with one packet at a time, fold the parchment over the fish, making the edges of the parchment even with each other. Starting at the bottom of the fold, tightly crimp the edges of the parchment to seal, making a half-moon-shaped packet (I highly recommend just googling a picture).
8. Arrange the packets on a large baking sheet. Bake for about 12 minutes, until the fish just barely starts to flake when pulled apart with a fork.
9. To serve, place each packet on a dinner plate and open!
