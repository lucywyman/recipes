##### Ingredients:

* 2¼ cups white whole wheat flour or whole wheat pastry flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* ¾ teaspoon salt
* 1 ½ sticks (12 Tablespoons of butter), at room temperature
* 1 cup sugar
* ½ cup honey
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 3 large eggs
* 1 cup buttermilk

##### Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Butter and flour the loaf pan and muffin tins.
2. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt together in a small bowl and set aside.
3. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, whip the butter, sugar and honey on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes.  
4. Add the vanilla extract.  
5. Add the eggs one at a time, beating for about one minute after each addition.  Scrape down the bowl as needed.  
6. Add the dry mixture and buttermilk in three additions, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients.  Stop the mixer and scrape the bottom of the bowl with a spatula to make sure everything is evenly incorporated.
7. Transfer the batter to the prepared pans.  
8. Smooth the top down and bake the cake for about  hour and the muffins for about 20 to 25 minutes.  The cake will be a lovely golden brown and a thin knife inserted into the center of the cake will come out clean.

Let the cake cool in the pan for 20 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
