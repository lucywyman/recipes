#### Ingredients:

* 2 15oz containers vegetable (or chicken) broth
* 1 28oz can crushed tomatoes
* 1 cup heavy cream
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Â¼ cup shredded basil (optional)

<br>

#### Directions:

1. Combine broth and tomatoes in a medium saucepan over moderate heat (6 or 7 on 1-10 scale).
2. When soup begins to bubble (5-10 minutes), stir in cream and reduce heat to low (3).
3. Season with salt, pepper, and basil leaves, and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes, stirring occassionally.
4. Pour into a blender and blend until smooth (my blender is small-ish, so I had to do this
   in three parts. Make sure you give it some room in the blender to move around, or it
   will spill!)
5. Garnish with parmesan, bread crusts, more basil, or any other toppings you'd like.
