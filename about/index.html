  <p>A curated index of recipes, this site aims to simplify some of the best
  recipes on the internet so that you can make them on a budget!	All recipes
  are ones I've tested and <i>loved</i>, so that you don't have to find out
  the hard way that whipped sweet potatoes with lemon juice are really not
  all that. To know more about how the site is made, check out the 'This site' 
  section.</p>

  <p>I'm a software engineer for Puppet, where I'm currently working on
  our open source remote task runner <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt">Bolt</a>. I graduated
  from Oregon State University with a BS in Computer Science in June
  2016, where I worked as a Front-End Engineer for the <a href="http://osuosl.org">OSU Open Source Lab</a>. In my free time
  I enjoy hanging out with friends, hiking, experiencing new things,
  and enjoying a wide variety of podcasts, tv shows, blogs, books,
  and other media.<br><br>
