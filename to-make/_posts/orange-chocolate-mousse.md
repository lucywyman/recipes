##### Directions:

1. Place chocolate bar pieces in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave at 20 second intervals until melted (stirring after each interval). You can use a double-boiler instead if you prefer.
2. Combine tofu and orange juice in a blender or food processor; process until smooth. Add remaining ingredients and process until well-combined. Chill in refrigerator for 1 hour before serving.
