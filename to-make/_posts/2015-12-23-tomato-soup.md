#### Ingredients:

* 1 cup chopped yellow onion
* 3 long carrots, peeled and thinly sliced in rounds

#### Directions:

1. Add all of the ingredients, except the peanut butter to a pot. 
2. Stir well and turn to high heat. 
3. Bring it to a boil and once it starts boiling, stir once more and then cover with a lid and turn the heat down to medium-low. 
4. Let it cook covered on medium-low for 25-30 minutes until the carrots are very soft. Stir a couple of times during and to check on the carrots.
5. Once the carrots are tender, turn the heat off. 
6. Very carefully pour the soup into a blender, it's HOT! Add the peanut butter.
7. Blend on high until completely smooth and creamy. Taste and add anymore salt or dried herbs. 
8. Pour into bowls. I liked to add extra dried herbs and freshly ground black pepper on top and serve it with toasted bread.
