##### Directions:

1. Heat the quinoa and set aside.
2. Now barely cook the broccoli by pouring ¾ cup water into a large pot and bringing it to a simmer.
3. Add a big pinch of salt and stir in the broccoli.
4. Cover and cook for a minute, just long enough to take the raw edge off.
5. Transfer the broccoli to a strainer. Set aside.
6. To make the broccoli pesto, puree two cups of the cooked broccoli, the garlic, almonds, Parmesan, salt, and lemon juice in a food processor. Drizzle in the olive oil and cream and pulse until smooth.
7. Just before serving, toss the quinoa and remaining broccoli florets with about ½ of the broccoli pesto. Taste and adjust if needed, you might want to add more of the pesto a bit at a time, or you might want a bit more salt or an added squeeze of lemon juice. Top with toppings and serve!
