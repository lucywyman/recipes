#### Ingredients:

* 1 large banana, ripe
* 2 large eggs, farm fresh preferred
* ¼ of vanilla bean pod seeds
* pinch of pink sea salt
* dash of ground cinnamon


<br>

#### Directions:

1. Simply put the ingredients into a high speed blender and blend until smooth. If you don't have a blender, in a large bowl you can mash the banana with the back of a fork and beat the eggs into it until well combined and smooth (no chunks of banana).
2. Heat a nonstick skillet or crepe pan to medium/low heat, grease the pan well with coconut oil and pour about ¼ cup of the mixture in at a time.
3. You'll flip the crepe gently when bubbles start to form or when the bottom becomes golden brown, be very gentle when flipping.
4. Continue to cook until both sides are slightly golden brown. Repeat with remaining amount of batter.
