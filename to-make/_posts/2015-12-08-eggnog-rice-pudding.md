#### Ingredients:

* 2 cups water
* 1 cup rice
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* 3 cups milk of choice
* 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
* 1 cup eggnog

<br>

#### Directions:

1. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. 
2. Stir in rice and salt. Turn the heat to low and simmer the rice, covered, until all of the water is absorbed. Set aside.
3. Over low heat, add 3 cups of milk, nutmeg, sugar, and vanilla extract to the cooked rice. 
4. Bring to a low boil, stirring often so the milk doesn’t burn. 
5. Stir often, until the milk cooks down and the rice is creamy, about 20 minutes. 
6. Add the eggnog and cook for 10 minutes more, until thickened. 
7. Place in a large bowl or serving dishes to cool. Serve cold or at room temperature. Garnish with ground nutmeg.
