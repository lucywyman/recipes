title: How This Site Was Made
---

This site has been my pet project for a few months now, and has been
the testing ground for some tools and techniques that I wanted to try
out.  If you like the site, or are interested in how it's made, read 
on!  A fair warning: these articles are reasonably technical. I don't plan on
explaining everything I refer to, or start from the ground up on how
to make a website, but I will provide links to where you can read more
information about what I'm talking about if you aren't familiar with
programming, websites, the particular tools I'm using. 

Ingredients:
------------

* [Jekyll](/initialization.html), a static site generator, is what I use to essentially build the site.  As you can infer, then, it's a static site, and in fact since I'm using Github pages, it's a strictly static site -- even the forms are all done client-side (kind of...see the [Simple Form](#) section for more information.
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com), a CSS preprocessor I use on all my sites to make writing CSS just a little less painful.  I highly recommend it, and have even [given a talk](http://slides.lucywyman.me/sass) on it.
* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is where I host the site, mostly because I'm lazy and it works.  I chose to make this site purely static, and you can [read why here](/static.html).  
* [Simple Form](https://getsimpleform.com/) was used to create the form. It seems a little sketchy at first, but I haven't had any problems with it thus far, and it does what I need it to!
* [Slicknav](#) was used to create the mobile menu (which you should totally try out -- I'm actually really proud of it).

Directions:
-----------

1. [Initialize](/initialization.html) your jekyll site.
2. [Configure your site](/configuration.html).  There are a few helpful hints I have for configuring a jekyll site; for instance, you can create directories in the root of your  website, give them an ``_post`` subdirectory, and all posts in that subdir will autocatically be categorized according to the parent directory.
3. [The Plugins](/plugins.html). I used a couple of awesome plugins to add a search bar and contact form.
4. [Sass](http://
5. [Social Media](/social-media.html). Giving users the ability to share my content on social media, and make it look nice, was surprisingly difficult (and as of this writing has not actually happened yet).
