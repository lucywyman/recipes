#### Directions:

1. Add strawberries and raspberries to a blender and puree until smooth.
2. Then add maple syrup, vanilla, coconut cream, soaked cashews, and coconut oil and blend at the highest power for 10-15 seconds until smooth and creamy.
3. Now you can do two things. Either pour the mixture into silicone cups OR pour the mixture onto parchment paper, smooth out and garnish
with shredded coconut and chocolate chips. Make these treats however you'd like to eat them.
4. Place in freeze to freeze for 2+ hours. Serve immediately and store in freezer.
