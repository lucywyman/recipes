##### Ingredients:

* 1 large egg yolk
* 1 ½ teaspoons fresh lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
* ½ teaspoon salt plus more to taste
* ¾ cup canola oil, divided

<br>

##### Directions:

1. Combine egg yolk, lemon juice, vinegar, and salt in medium bowl. Whisk until blended and bright yellow,
about 30 seconds.
2. Using ¼ teaspoon measure and whisking constantly, add ¼ cup
oil to yolk mixture, a few drops at a time, about 4 minutes. Note: I
used a hand mixer at the lowest speed.
3. Gradually add remaining ½ cup oil in very slow thin stream, whisking
constantly, until mayonnaise is thick, about 8 minutes (mayonnaise
will be lighter in color). 

Cover and chill. Mayo keeps for up to 2 days
