#### Directions:

1. Put racks in the center and upper third of the oven and preheat the
oven to 400Â°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and set
aside.
2. In a medium bowl mix the flours, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder,
baking soda, and salt.
3. Add the sage, and using your fingers or a pastry cutter cut in the
butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal
4. In a separate bowl, using a fork, beat together the heavy cream and
1 egg. 
5. Pour it into the flour mixture and stir enough to make a shaggy
dough
6. Dump the mixture onto a well floured surface and knead until the
dough comes together, 10-15 turns
7. Roll or pat the dough until it is a little less than 1/2 inch
thick.
8. Brush half of the dough with a thin coating of cream.
9. Arrange the peach slices in a single layer across the cream.
Carefully fold the other side of the dough over the peaches.
10. Press together gently.
11. Add a bit of flour to your hands and press the edges of the dough
in, creating more of a rectangle shape than a half-circle shape.
12. Using a floured knife, cut the dough into 8 squares.
13. Transfer the scones to the prepared baking sheets, leaving 11/2
inches between them. If the dough has warmed and feels mushy, chill in
the fridge for 20 minutes.
14. Lightly beat remaining egg and brush the scones with it. Sprinkle
the scones with sugar
15. Bake until golden brown, 15-18 minutes. Serve warm. Scones are
best eaten the day they're made, but will keep for up to 2 days.
