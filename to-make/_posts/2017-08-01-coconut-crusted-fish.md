#### Ingredients:

* 3 tilapia or any white fish filets
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* juice of 1 lime
* sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper

* ½ cup panko bread crumbs, crushed finer

#### Directions:

1. Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat oven to 375° F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly grease with nonstick cooking spray.
2. Sprinkle fish with olive oil, lime juice, and a good sprinkling of salt and pepper. Brush with your hands or a brush to make sure the fish is coated.
3. In a separate medium bowl, toss together coconut, bread crumbs, spices, salt and pepper. 
4. Add the moistened fish to the bowl to generously coat in the spiced coconut topping. 
5. Place the well coated fish on the prepared baking sheet and continue until all the filets are coated and placed on the pan.
6. Bake until golden brown and cooked through, about 12 minutes. You shouldn't have to flip the fish pieces, but take a peek in the oven at about 8 minutes to see if you'd like to flip.
7. Remove and you're done! This recipe is excellent if you cut the fish into pieces and include in a taco
