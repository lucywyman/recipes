Contributing
============

If you're interested in adding a recipe to the site, check out
`the 'submit a recipe' page <http://recipes.lucywyman.me/submit>`_. 
I'll review your recipe within the week, try it out, and add it
if we dig it!  

If you're interested in contributing code, or find an issue with 
the site, you can:

1. Submit `an issue <https://github.com/lucywyman/recipes/issues>`_ detailing what the problem is and how to replicate it.  Make it clear so that I know what trouble you're having!
2. Fork the project by clicking the big green 'Fork' button in the top right hand corner. 
3. Create a new branch by running :code:`git checkout -b <YOUR USERNAME>/<ISSUE NUMBER>`
4. Make any changes you'd like to make. If you aren't familiar with `jekyll <http://jekyllrb.com>`_, you can check out their `documentation <http://jekyllrb.com/docs>`_ to learn more.  If you have any questions, feel free to email me or ping me on IRC and ask!
5. Commit your changes and push them to your branch. :code:`git push origin <YOUR USERNAME>/<ISSUE NUMBE>`.  
6. Make a pull request!  You can either do this by hitting the big green "Pull request" button that pops up right after you push to your branch, or by going to https://github.com/lucywyman/recipes and submitting a pr there.

And then you're done!  I check github regularly, and also get emails
when someone makes a pull request or issue on the project.  I should
respond within the week to one or the other, and hopefully we can get
your contribution merged shortly after that!  

As always, if you have any questions you can email me at wyman.lucy[at]gmail or ping me, lucyw, on irc.freenode.net.
