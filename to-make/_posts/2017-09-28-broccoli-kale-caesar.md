2. Place the broccoli florets and unpeeled garlic cloves on a baking sheet.

5. Squeeze out the garlic from their skins into a high-powered blender. Drain the water from the cashews and add to the blender. 
6. Add the broth or water, oil, and lemon juice. Blend on high speed until very smooth (if it is too thick, blend in a few more splashes of water). Taste and season well with salt and pepper; set aside.
7. Place the kale, remaining 1 tablespoonspoon of oil, and a big pinch of salt in a large bowl. 
8. Massage with your hands to soften the leaves, then let sit for 5 minutes.
