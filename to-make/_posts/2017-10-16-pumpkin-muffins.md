##### Ingredients:

* 1¾ cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* ½ teaspoon ground ginger

* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 

<br>

##### Directions:

1. Prep and preheat: Heat the oven to 350°F. Prepare a 12-cup muffin pan (or two 6-cup muffins pans) with liners, or skip the liners and just grease the cups.
2. Mix the dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and salt. Set aside.
3. Cream the butter and sugar: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes.
4. Add the eggs: Add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until combined.
5. Add the pumpkin purée: Mix in the pumpkin purée and vanilla extract.
6. Add the dry ingredients: Stir in the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Do not overmix.
7. Divide the batter: Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups so they are ¾ of the way full.
8. Bake the muffins: Place the muffin tin in the oven. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes, until a tester comes out with few crumbs.
9. Cool the muffins: Let the muffins cool enough to handle, then transfer them to a wire rack to finish cooling.
