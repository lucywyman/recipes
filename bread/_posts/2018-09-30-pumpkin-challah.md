##### Directions:

1. Pour 100 ml of the lukewarm water (about 110°F) into a large mixing bowl.
2. Add packet of yeast and 1 tsp of sugar to the bowl, stir to dissolve.
3. Wait 10 minutes. The yeast should have activated, meaning it will look expanded and foamy. If it doesn't, your yeast may have expired, which means your bread won’t rise—go buy some fresh yeast!
4. Once your yeast has activated, add remaining lukewarm water to the bowl along with the rest of the sugar, egg, egg yolks, honey, canola oil, salt and spices.
5. Use a whisk to thoroughly blend the ingredients together.
6. Whisk in the brown sugar and pumpkin puree to form a thick liquid. 
7. Begin adding the flour to the bowl by half-cupfuls, stirring with a large spoon each time flour is added. When mixture becomes too thick to stir, use your hands to knead.
8. Continue to add flour and knead the dough until it’s smooth, elastic, and not sticky. The amount of flour you will need to achieve this texture varies—only add flour until the dough feels pliable and “right.”
9. Place a saucepan full of water on the stove to boil.
10. Meanwhile, remove the dough from your mixing bowl and wash out the bowl.
11. Grease the bowl with canola oil. Push the dough back into the bottom of the bowl, then flip it over so that both sides are slightly moistened by the oil.
12. Cover the bowl with a clean, damp kitchen towel. Place the bowl of dough on the middle rack of your oven. 
13. Take the saucepan full of boiling water and place it below the rack where your dough sits.
14. Close the oven, but do not turn it on. The pan of hot water will create a warm, moist environment for your dough to rise.
15. Let the dough rise for 1 hour.
16. Take the dough bowl out and punch it down several times to remove air pockets.
17. Place it back inside the oven and let it rise for 1 hour longer.
18. Take the dough out of the oven. Flour a smooth surface like a cutting board.
19. Punch the dough down into the bowl a few times, then turn the dough out onto the floured surface. 
20. Knead for a few minutes, adding flour as needed to keep the dough from feeling sticky.
21. Divide the dough into 3 equal sections. Roll each section into a long thin rope, then braid the ropes together
22. Place the loaf on a cookie sheet covered with wax paper
23. Prepare your egg wash by beating the egg yolks and water till smooth.
24. Use a pastry brush to brush a thin layer of the mixture onto the visible surface of your challah.
25. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
26. Let the loaf rise 30 to 45 minutes longer. You’ll know the dough is ready to bake when you press your finger into the dough and the indentation stays, rather than bouncing back.
27. Bake challah for 40 minutes, turning halfway through.
28. Take the challah out of the oven. You can test the bread for doneness by turning it over and tapping on the bottom of the loaf—if it makes a hollow sound, it’s done.

Let challah cool on the baking sheet or a wire cooling rack before serving.
