##### Directions:
1. In a blender, combine ricotta, eggs, lemon juice, water and lemon zest.
Blend until well mixed, about 10 seconds.

Add flour, sweetener, coconut flour, baking powder and salt and blend
until mixture is smooth.

Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat and add butter or
oil. Once pan is hot, spoon about 3 tbsp of batter into 4 inch circles
and let cook until edges look dry, a few small bubbles appear on the
top, and the underside is golden brown. Flip carefully and continue to
cook until second side is golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.

Remove and keep pancakes warm while repeating with remaining batter.
You should get about 12 pancakes.

Serve pancakes with butter and mixed berry syrup.
