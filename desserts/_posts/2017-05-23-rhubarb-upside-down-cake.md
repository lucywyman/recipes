To be perfectly honest, this is more of a large rhubarb-topped scone than an
upside down cake, but I'm perfectly OK with that. Best eaten warm, with fresh
whipped cream!

#### Ingredients:

* 3⁄4 lb. rhubarb (4-5 medium-large stalks), trimmed and cut into 1 1⁄2" pieces on an angle
* 11⁄2 cups sugar
* 4 tbsp. unsalted butter, plus 6 tbsp. cut into 1⁄2" cubes and chilled
* 1 tbsp. fresh lemon juice
* 2 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1⁄2 tsp. kosher salt
* 21⁄2 cups flour
* 2 tsp. baking powder
* 1⁄2 cup vegetable shortening
* 1⁄3 cup milk
* 2 eggs

#### Directions:

1. Heat oven to 375°F. 
2. Combine rhubarb, 1 cup sugar, 4 tbsp butter, lemon juice, vanilla, and 1⁄4 tsp salt in a 9" skillet over medium heat. Cast iron works best, as you can put it directly in the oven, but I used a regular nonstick pan then transferred into a cake pan for baking and it came out just fine. 
3. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar is melted and rhubarb is tender and slightly caramelized, 8-10 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, whisk together remaining sugar and salt, plus flour and baking powder in a bowl. 
5. Add remaining butter and the shortening and, using your fingers or a pastry cutter, rub into flour mixture to form coarse pea-size pieces. 
6. Add milk and eggs and stir until a soft, sticky dough forms (I ended up needing to add just a teaspoon more milk, but use your best judgement). 
6.5 If using a nonstick skillet, transfer the rhubarb mixture into an ungreased cake pan.
7. Place spoonfuls of dough over rhubarb mixture and smooth with a nonstick spatula. Imperfections are OK! Luckily, this will be the bottom of your cake.
8. Bake until the crust is golden and cooked through, about 30 minutes. 
9. Remove skillet from oven; place a large flat serving platter on top of the skillet and invert quickly and carefully. 

Serve warm or at room temperature with ice cream or whipped cream, if you like.
