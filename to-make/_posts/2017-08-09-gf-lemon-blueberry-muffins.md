##### Directions:

1. First, make the streusel by placing the butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Once the butter is melted, stir in all other ingredients with a fork. Stir until evenly distributed and set aside.
2. Preheat oven to 350°F and grease a muffin tin. 
3. For the batter, place the baking mix and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk to combine.
4. In a large bowl, whisk together the butter, eggs, milk, vanilla, and lemon juice & zest. 
5. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and stir until just combined. Fold in the blueberries.
6. Fill each muffin cup until almost full and sprinkle some streusel on top. Let muffins sit for 10 minutes. 
7. Place in oven and bake for 20-25 minutes or until a cake tester inserted into the muffins comes out clean.
8. While the muffins are baking, prepare your glaze. Place all ingredients in a small bowl and stir until no lumps remain.
9. After your muffins are done baking, let them rest for 5 minutes and then transfer to a cooling rack to let cool. 
10. Let muffins cool completely before drizzling some glaze on top. Let glaze harden before eating.
