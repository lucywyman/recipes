##### Directions:

###### For the Cake

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F / 180°C. Grease 2 2x20cm round cake tins.
2. Sift the flour and baking powder into a large bowl, then tip in all the other sponge ingredients. 
3. Using an electric whisk, beat everything together until smooth. 
4. Halve and stone the peaches, then cut each half into 4. 
5. Toss the peaches with the sugar, then arrange in a single layer in one of the tins. 
6. Tip half the cake mix over the peaches and the other half into the second tin. 
7. Bake for 20-25 mins until cooked and golden – the tin containing the peaches may take 5-10 mins longer than the other. Leave to cool on a wire rack while you make the filling.

###### For the Filling

1. Whisk the whipping cream in an electric mixer until frothy, about 2-3 minutes. 
2. Add the vanilla and powdered sugar while the mixer is going
3. Continue to whisk until soft peaks form, about 3-4 more minutes
