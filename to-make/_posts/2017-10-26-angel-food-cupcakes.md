8 teaspoons warm water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoons cream of tartar

##### For the Coconut Cream

##### Directions:

##### For the Cupcakes

1. In the bowl of a food processor, fitted with the blade attachment, grind sugar for about 2 minutes.  This will help create a super fine sugar that will be better absorbed into the egg whites.
2. Place half of the sugar in a small bowl.
3. In a large bowl, sift together the remaining sugar, salt, and cake flour.  Set aside.
4. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, fitted with a whisk attachment, beat together the egg whites, water, extract, and cream of tartar medium speed.  If you’re worried that the cream of tartar is too chunky don’t worry, it’ll smooth itself out.  
5. Beat on medium high, gradually adding the sugar from the small bowl, until medium (not stiff) peaks form.  The meringue will hold a trail of the beaters through it, be glossy, and won’t be overly foamy.
6. Remove the bowl from the mixer and sift in one quarter of the flour and sugar mixture.  Fold with a spatula.  Try to avoid stirring the mixture too much.  Instead, sweep the egg whites from the bottom of the bowl to the top, incorporating the flour.  
7. Add flour mixture in three more batches.  Fold until thoroughly combine, but don’t overmix or deflate the egg whites.
8. Spoon batter into ungreased cupcake pan
9. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in the cake comes out clean.  

##### For the Coconut Cream
1. In a large bowl beat together coconut cream, sugar, and vanilla extract until it holds soft peaks. If you're using coconut milk, first scrape off all of the coconut cream from the top of the can (the coconut water is great for smoothies!). 
2. Beat the cream with the sugar and vanilla. Soft peaks will appear after about 5 minutes. Do not overbeat! If you do, put back in the refrigerator for ~30 minutes, then try again.
