##### Directions:

1. Heat the coconut oil in a large saucepan over medium. Once it's melted, add the onion and garlic; cook for about 5 minutes, or until softened.
2. Stir in the kale leaves and cook for 5 minutes, until cooked down and wilted. Pour in the vegetable broth and bring to a boil.
3. Add the broccoli florets. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook for 5 minutes, or until the broccoli is tender.
4. Allow the mixture to cool slightly, then transfer to a blender and puree until smooth. Add the coconut milk and blend to incorporate, then season to taste with salt and pepper.
5. Divide the soup into 2 bowls and garnish as desired.
