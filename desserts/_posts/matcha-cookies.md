##### Ingredients:

* ½ stick butter, softened
* ½ cup of granulated sugar
* ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 egg
* ½ cup + 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon culinary grade matcha powder
* ½ teaspoon baking powder
* Pinch of salt

##### Directions:

1. Cream together the butter and sugar with an electric mixer - it should be creamy colored and airy.
2. Gently incorporate the egg to the butter mixture.
3. In a separate bowl, sift together all the dry ingredients.
4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet by adding a little at a time and folding or gently mixing the batter together. Keep going until you've incorporated all the remaining flour mixture. The dough should be a beautiful green color.
5. Chill the dough for at least an hour - up to overnight. The longer the better!
6. Preheat your oven to 325°F.
7. Roll the dough into balls the size of ping pong balls and place them on a non-stick cookie sheet.
8. Bake them for 12-15 minutes until the bottoms just start to become golden brown and the cookie no longer looks wet in the middle.
9. Remove and let cool on a rack and enjoy!
