##### Directions:

###### For the cake
1. Place an oven rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat oven to 350°F. Line two 6-inch, one 8-inch, or five thin 6-inch pans with parchment paper, and grease the sides of the pan with coconut oil. (The parchment will really help the cakes not to stick to the bottom of the pan. If you skip this step for some reason and just grease the pans, be sure to remove the cakes from the pan when they're still juuuust slightly warm.)
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, maple syrup, and vanilla. 
4. A little at a time, add the dry ingredients to the wet, stirring until a batter forms.
5. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake for 12 to 24 minutes (depending on which pan you use) or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs. 
6. Remove cakes from the oven and allow to rest and cool slightly. Invert cakes onto wire racks and allow to cool completely.

###### For the frosting
1. In a small heavy saucepan, over medium heat, melt the chocolate and coconut oil, stirring constantly. 
2. Remove the pan from the heat. 
3. Slowly add the maple syrup and stir to incorporate. 
4. Allow to cool completely. 
5. Transfer the chocolate mixture to a medium bowl and, using an electric mixer, beat in the almond butter until a thick frosting forms. 
6. Add the almond or coconut milk and beat with the mixer until smooth.
7. For a creamy, almost pourable frosting, use immediately. For a fluffy frosting, refrigerate the frosting for 8 hours, then bring to room temperature and beat with an electric mixer until spreadable. (I refrigerated the frosting mixture for 4 hours and beat if from cold with the mixer until warmed to room temperature, fluffy and spreadable.)

###### For the raspberry sauce

1. In a medium saucepan over medium heat combine the raspberries, maple syrup, and lemon juice. 
2. Cook, stirring and mashing the berries for 8 to 10 minutes until the juices have released and thickened. 
3. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the mixture to cool.
4. Transfer the jam to a glass jar. Refrigerate until ready to use, or up to 5 days.

###### Assembly

1. Place one layer on a cake plate and top with chocolate frosting. 
2. Spoon over a thin layer of raspberry sauce. 
3. Top with the next layer cake and continue until you reach the last layer. We'll leaves the sides bare. 

Store cake in the refrigerator before serving but allow to rest outside of the fridge to get the big chill off just before serving.
