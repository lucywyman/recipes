##### Directions:

1. Whisk together flours, salt, spices, sugar and baking powder in a medium sized bowl.  
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together milk, egg, pumpkin and vegetablespoon oil or melted butter.  
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined.  Don’t worry if you have a few lumps.  You don’t want to over beat the batter, it’ll produce tough pancakes.  
4. Let the batter sit for 10 minutes while you heat the skillet.  
5. Over low-medium heat melt a tablespoonspoon of butter or vegetablespoon oil. Once skillet is hot, spoon a heaping 2 tablespoonspoons of batter per pancake into the skillet.  
6. When pancake starts to bubble slightly, carefully flip over.
7. Once browned and cooked through place pancakes on a plate. Enjoy!

**Tip**: While you're cooking the rest of the pancakes, we generally heat the over to it's lowest temperature and put the pancakes on an oven-proof plate, and keep them in there to stay warm
