##### Directions:

###### Crust

1. Add the flour, sugar and salt to a food processor and pulse just until combined. 
2. In a small bowl, whisk mix together the egg, vinegar and water. 
3. Add the cold butter pieces into the food processor and pulse until small coarse crumbs remain. 
4. Sprinkle the water/egg mixture over the flour and pulse again until the dough comes together.
5. Remove the dough with your hands and wrap it in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes.
6. After 30 minutes, preheat the oven to 400Â°F.

###### Filling 

1. Place the cherries in a bowl. Toss with the sugar, cornstarch and salt, making sure to coat all the cherries. Drizzle in the vanilla extract and toss.
2. Remove crust from the fridge. Roll the pie crusts into a rough circle until it is about 1/4 inch thick. 
3. Place the dough on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Places the cherries in the center leaving a 2-inch+ border of crust. Top with the butter cubes.
4. Once the cherries are placed, fold the crust over top of them. Brush the crust with the beaten egg wash. Sprinkle it with the raw sugar. 
5. Bake the galette until the crust is golden, about 40 to 45 minutes.
6. Remove it and let cool slightly, then slice. Serve warm with ice cream or whipped cream.
