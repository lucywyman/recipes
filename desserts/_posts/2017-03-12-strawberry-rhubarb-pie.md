#### Ingredients:

##### For the Crust

* 2 ½ cup all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* ¾ teaspoon salt
* 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cold, cut into cubes
* ½ cup cold buttermilk

##### For the Filling

* 3 cups ½-inch thick sliced rhubarb (about 1 pound)
* 1 pound strawberries, hulled and sliced in half
* ⅓ cup light brown sugar, packed
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* ¼ cup cornstarch
* large pinch of salt
* 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

#### Directions:

##### To make the crust
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar and salt. 
2. Add cold, cubed butter and, using your fingers, work the butter into the flour mixture. 
3. Quickly break the butter down into the flour mixture. Some butter pieces will be the size of oat flakes; some will be the size of peas. 
4. Create a well in the mixture and pour in the cold buttermilk. 
5. Use a fork to bring the dough together. Try to moisten all of the flour bits. 
6. On a lightly floured work surface, dump out the dough mixture. It will be moist and shaggy. That’s perfect. 
7. Divide the dough in two and gently knead into two disks. 
8. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Allowing the dough to rest in the refrigerator will help rechill the butter and distribute the moisture.

##### To make the filling
1. In a medium bowl, toss together rhubarb, strawberries, sugars, cornstarch, salt, and lemon juice.  
2. Toss until all of the fruit is covered in a coating of sugar and cornstarch.  The cornstarch will disappear and the sugars will begin to make juice with the fruit.
3. Allow to rest at room temperature while you make the topping.

##### To assemble
1. To assemble the pie, on a well-floured surface, roll the bottom crust 1/8″ thick and about 12″ in diameter. Transfer it to a pie pan. 
2. Trim the edge almost even with the edge of the pan.
3. Spoon filling into piecrust.
4. Roll out the top crust in the same manner. Use a pizza slicer to slice the dough into 1-inch wide strips and weave the crust strips on top of the pie. Use this guide to help you:

6. To finish, place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat oven to 400° F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
7. Brush the egg wash over pie crust, then sprinkle with sugar.
8. Place pie on baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 350°F and bake the pie for 30 minutes more, or until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbling. 
9. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely before serving.
