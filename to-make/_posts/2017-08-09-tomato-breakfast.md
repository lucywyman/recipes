##### Ingredients:

* 4 thick slices of tomato (¼- to ½-inch thick)
* Olive oil
* Salt and pepper
* 1 medium ear of corn, with the husk still on
* ½ tablespoonspoon unsalted butter
* 4 large eggs, beaten
* 2 ounces goat cheese

##### Directions:

1. Set your oven's broiler on high with a rack a few inches below the broiler element. 
2. Drizzle the tomato slices with a bit of olive oil, coating both sides, and season with salt and pepper. 
3. Put them on a baking sheet and broil in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes, until beginning to caramelize on top.
4. While the tomatoes are cooking, microwave the corn (in its husk) for 3 minutes on high. Remove from the microwave and let cool for a few minutes, then strip off the husk and cut the kernels from the cob.
5. Heat the butter in a frying pan over medium heat. 
6. Add the corn, season with salt and pepper, and cook for 1 minute. 
7. Add the eggs and scramble — this shouldn't take more than a minute, although if you like your eggs creamy, you may want to lower the heat and cook them more slowly. 
8. Once the eggs are scrambled to your liking, turn off the heat and crumble in the goat cheese.
9. Use a spatula to transfer the tomato slices to a plate, then top with the eggs. Season with more salt and pepper to taste.
