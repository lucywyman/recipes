##### Ingredients:

* ½ cup pecans
* Neutral oil such as olive oil
* salt
* 1-2 pound butternut squash
* ½ pound chicken breast
* ½ cup slivered shallots
* 3 tablespoons sherry vinegar
* 7-ounce bag arugula
* several sprigs fresh thyme
* 8-ounce package goat's cheese

<br>

##### Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
2. Toss the pecans with a little canola oil and sea salt, and roast until fragrant, about 7 to 10 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, peel and seed the squash and cut into ½-inch cubes. 
4. Toss with a little canola oil on two baking sheets (do not crowd) and sprinkle with more of the sea salt. 
5. When the pecans are done, remove from the oven, raise the temperature to 425°F and roast the squash until it's soft and the edges are deep brown.
6. While the squash roasts, cut the chicken into 1-inch cubes and fry it up in a large skillet.
7. Keep the pan hot and add 6 tablespoons oil to the pan. Add the shallots and saute over medium heat until they soften. 
8. Turn off the heat and add the vinegar. Swirl to combine. Add a few turns of the pepper mill's worth of fresh black pepper.

The salad can be served now, with the ingredients still warm, or at room temperature. 

To assemble: 
1. In a large bowl, toss the dressing with the squash and chicken. 
2. Add several large handfuls of the arugula. 
3. Strip about three or four sprigs of thyme leaves into the bowl and add the pecans (which should be broken into pieces if they're not already.) Toss gently. 
4. Dot with the goat cheese (you may not need all of it) and serve.
