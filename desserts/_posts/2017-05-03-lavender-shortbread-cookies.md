##### Ingredients:

* 1 tablespoon dried lavender blossoms
* ½ cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 2 ½ cup all-purpose flour
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* 1 eggs, beaten (for egg wash)
* extra sugar for sprinkling on top

##### Directions:

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour and salt.  Set aside.
2. In a small spice grinder (I use my cleaned out coffee grinder) to
grind up 1 tablespoon lavender and 1 tablespoon sugar. Grind it up!
You could also use a mortar and pestle to grind the sugar and lavender
together.
3. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, fitted with a paddle
attachment add butter, ground lavender mixture, and remaining ½ cup
sugar.  
4. Cream on medium speed until slightly more pale and fluffy,
about 5 minutes.  There will still be raw sugar bits floating around.
That’s fine.  
5. Stop the mixer, add the flour.  
6. Mix on low speed until
dough comes together.  The dough will be crumbly, then begin to form
when it continues to mix.  
7. Dump dough mixture out onto a clean surface
and form into a ball with your hands.  Wrap in plastic wrap and
refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
8. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.  Set aside.
9. On a lightly floured work surface, roll dough out to a ¼-inch thickness.  
10. Use a 1 ½-inch round cookie cutter to cut cookies, or use a pizza cutter to slice cookies into squares.  Use a fork to prick cookies.  Brush very lightly with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar.  Refrigerate cookies
while oven preheats.
11. Place racks in the center and upper third of the oven.  Preheat oven
to 350 degrees F.  
12. When oven is preheated, bake cookies for 8 to 11
minutes, until just browned around the edges.  Remove from oven.
13. Allow to cool on the cookie sheet for 10 minutes then remove to a wire
rack to cool completely.

Cookies last, in an airtight container at room temprature, for up to 4
days.
