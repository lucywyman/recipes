##### Ingredients:

* 2 teaspoons butter
* 1 onion, sliced
* Salt and black pepper
* 4 to 6 cups of any chopped or sliced raw vegetables
* ¼ cup fresh basil or parsley leaves, or any other herb
* 3 eggs
* ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (or other cheese you have around!)

##### Directions:

1. Put butter in a skillet (preferably nonstick or well-seasoned cast iron) and turn heat to medium. 
2. When fat is hot, add onion and cook, sprinkling with salt and pepper 3 to 5 minutes. 
3. Add vegetables, raise heat and cook, stirring occasionally until they soften, from a couple of minutes for greens to 15 minutes for sliced potatoes. 
4. Adjust heat so vegetables brown a little without scorching. 
5. When vegetables are nearly done, turn heat to low and add herb. 
6. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender.
7. Meanwhile, beat eggs with some salt and pepper, along with cheese. 
8. Pour over vegetables, distributing them evenly. 
9. Cook, undisturbed, until eggs are barely set, 10 minutes or so; run pan under broiler for a minute or 2 if top does not set. 

Cut frittata into wedges and serve hot, warm or at room temperature.
