#### Ingredients:

* 1 cup peanut butter or allergy-friendly alternative (230g) 
* 3 medium bananas (300g) 
* 2 tsp pure vanilla extract
* 1/8 tsp salt, plus pinch more if using unsalted pb
* ¼ cup virgin coconut oil, melted (Can sub with ¼ cup extra pb; the texture will just change) (50g)
* stevia extract to taste, or 3-4 tbsp powdered sugar, or pure maple syrup

<br>

#### Directions:

1. Blend everything together very, very well. (I used a Vita-mix for this.) 
2. Pour into a prepared pie crust or springform pan--this pie can easily be crustless!--and freeze until firm. (If not using the coconut oil, just chill in the fridge instead.) 
3. Pie should be kept cold; I keep it in the freezer. Just thaw before eating, and the mousse-like texture will come right back! 
4. If you want a deeper-dish pie, use: 1 ½ c peanut butter, 4 ½ bananas, 1 tbsp vanilla, a little over 1/8 tsp salt, ¼c plus 2 tbsp coconut oil, and stevia to taste or 5 tbsp powdered sugar.
