* ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* Cooking spray or butter
* 2 medium shallots, diced

##### Directions:

1. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 425°F.
2. Place the sweet potatoes in a medium bowl and toss with 2 teaspoons of the olive oil and ½ teaspoon of the salt. 
3. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and arrange in a single layer. 
4. Roast until tender and the edges are lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes; set aside. 
5. Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F. 
6. Generously coat a 8" or 9" square baking dish with butter or cooking spray.
7. Heat the remaining teaspoon of oil in a large, high-sided skillet over medium heat until shimmering. 
8. Add the shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. 
9. Add the garlic, kale, paprika, ¼ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of pepper. 
10. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the kale is slightly wilted, 4 to 5 minutes. 
11. Stir in the roasted sweet potatoes. Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.
12. Whisk the eggs, sour cream, and remaining ¼ teaspoon of salt in a large bowl until combined.
13. Spread the kale and sweet potatoes in an even layer in the prepared baking dish. 
14. Pour the egg mixture over the vegetables. Sprinkle with the cheese.
15. Bake uncovered until the eggs are set, start to pull away from the sides of the dish, and are golden-brown on top, 30 to 35 minutes. 

Let the casserole cool for 5 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature.
