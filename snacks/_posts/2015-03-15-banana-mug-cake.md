##### Ingredients:

* 3 tbsp spelt, white, or oat flour
* ¼ tsp baking powder
* 1/16 tsp salt
* pinch stevia, or 2 tsp sugar
* 1 tbsp plus 2 tsp water
* 1 tbsp overripe mashed banana
* ¼ tsp pure vanilla extract

##### Directions:

0. For the top, combine: ¼ tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp brown sugar or xylitol or sucanat, 2 tsp overripe mashed banana, tiny pinch salt, 1 tsp buttery spread OR 1 tsp more mashed banana, optional crumbled pecans or walnuts.
1. Grease a small mug or 1-cup dish, and set aside.
2. In a small bowl, combine all cake dry ingredients, then add all cake liquid ingredients and stir. 
3. Transfer the cake batter to the prepared dish, then spoon the streusel evenly on top. 
4. Either bake at 350F for 14 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean OR cook in the microwave until a toothpick comes out clean. (Microwave times will vary depending on wattage.) 
5. If you don’t want to eat the cake directly from the mug or dish, allow it to cool completely. Then run around the sides with a knife and it should pop right out!
