#### Ingredients:

##### Crust

* 1 cup packed dates, pitted (if dry, soak in warm water for 10 minutes then drain)
* 1½ cups raw walnuts (or sub almonds or rolled oats)
* 3 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa or cacao powder
* Pinch sea salt

##### Filling

* 1½ cups raw cashews (soaked in water 4-6 hours, then drained OR pour boiling hot water over the cashews, soak for 1 hour, then drain and blend as instructed)
* 1 large lemon, juiced (scant ¼ cup)
* ¼ cup olive or melted coconut oil (or any neutral-flavored oil)
* 1 14-ounce can full-fat coconut milk (sub light coconut milk or another non-dairy milk for a less creamy result)
* 7 ounces dairy-free dark chocolate (chopped and melted over a double boiler or in microwave in 30 second increments)
* ¼ cup maple syrup or agave nectar (or honey if not vegan)

##### Optional Toppings

* Dairy-free peanut butter cups
* Peanut butter sauce
* Fresh berries
* Coconut Whipped Cream
* Cacao nibs

#### Directions:

1. Add dates to a food processor and blend until small bits remain and it forms into a ball. Remove and set aside.
2. Next add nuts, salt and cocoa powder and process into a meal. Then add dates back in and blend until a loose dough forms - it should stick together when you squeeze a bit between your fingers. If it's too dry, add a few more dates through the spout while processing. If too wet, add more almond or walnut meal.
3. Cut out parchment paper into circles the shape of your ramekins, muffin tins or pan (see notes for size options). In addition, to make removing the cheesecakes easier, cut out two strips of parchment paper per ramekin and lay them in an "X" shape at the base. Top with circle shape. This creates little tabs that make removing the cheesecakes easier to pop out once set.
4. Divide crust among serving dishes and carefully press with fingers to distribute. To pack it down, use a small glass or the back of a spoon to and really press it down, allowing some crust to come up the sides. If it sticks, separate the crust and glass with a small piece of parchment paper. Set in fridge or freezer to firm up.
5. Add all filling ingredients to a blender and mix until very smooth - up to 2-3 minutes. If it won't come together, add a touch more lemon juice, maple syrup/agave or a splash more coconut milk as the liquid should help it blend better.
6. Scrape down sides as needed and blend until very creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust flavor/sweetness as needed.
7. Divide filling evenly among the ramekins (or other serving dish). Tap a few times to release any air bubbles, then cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set - about 4-6 hours depending on size of dish. Expedite this process by popping them into the freezer for 1-2 hours.
8. Once set, run a butter knife along the edge and gently remove by tugging on the tabs in an upward motion. They should pop right out. If they aren't quite set, pop them in the freezer for 15-20 minutes and they should come out easily.
9. Top with a touch of coconut whipped cream and fresh berries, or as is! See notes for storage.

##### Notes

* Peanut Butter Sauce Recipe: ¼ cup Salted natural peanut butter + 1 Tbsp sweetener + ½ Tbsp melted coconut oil. Whisk to combine and warm if desired.
* These store well in the fridge for a few days, and in the freezer for up to a few weeks! Unlike my other cheesecake flavors, these stay firm at room temperature for hours, so if you’re taking this to a party, you’re good to go!
* Recipe creates 4 medium-sized cheesecakes (made in ramekins), ~12 mini cheesecakes (made in muffin tins), or 1 large cheesecake (made in a springform pan or round cake pan).
* Loosely adapted from my 7 Ingredient Vegan Cheesecakes.
* Nutrition information is a rough estimate for ⅓ of the above-size cheesecake, or approximately 1/12th of the recipe, without additional toppings (i.e. coconut whipped cream).
* Prep time does not include chilling / soaking.
