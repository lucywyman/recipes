#### Ingredients:

* 2 cups raw whole almonds
* 4 cups filtered water
* 3-4 tablespoons pure maple syrup
* ½ teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
* 1 heaping tablespoon pumpkin puree

<br>

#### Directions:

1. Almonds need some soaking before they can be turned into milk.
2. Rinse almonds thoroughly. Place in a medium bowl and cover the almonds with water. Cover with plastic wrap. 
3. Refrigerate and allow to soak for 1 or 2 days. The longer they soak the creamier the milk will be.
4. When ready to make the milk, drain the almonds from their soaking water and rinse.
5. Place in a blender with 4 cups of filtered water. (If your blender isn't large enough, do this in batches.) 
6. Blend until smooth and creamy.
7. Pour mixture into a fine mesh strainer placed over a medium bowl.
8. Press the almond meal through the fine mesh strainer until mostly dry. Press as much of the liquid as you can out of the meal.
9. Return to the blender and blend in the maple syrup, pumpkin pie spice, and pumpkin puree. Blend until combined. 
10. Milk will last in an airtight jar in the refrigerator for up to three days.
11. Almond meal can be spread onto a baking sheet and dried in the oven at 200° F. Grind in batches in a spice grinder and store in the freezer for recipes and smoothies.
