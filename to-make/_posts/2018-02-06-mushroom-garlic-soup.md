##### Ingredients:

* 2 1/2 pounds mushrooms (such as shiitake, maitake, chanterelles, etc.), roughly chopped
* 1 teaspoon fresh thyme

##### Directions:

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. 
2. Slice the tops off the garlic heads to expose the cloves. 
3. Drizzle on the melted coconut oil. 
4. Top the garlic with a small piece of unbleached parchment paper, then wrap the heads in aluminum foil. 
5. Add the garlic to a small baking dish and bake in the oven until soft and caramelized, about 45-55 minutes.
6. Remove the garlic from the oven, and allow to cool. 
7. Squeeze or scoop out the cloves into a small bowl and set aside.
8. Preheat a large pot or Dutch oven on medium heat. Melt about 1/2 tablespoon coconut oil and add the leek, with a pinch of sea salt. Cook, stirring often, until soft, about 5 minutes.
9. Add the mushrooms and thyme and sauté, stirring often, until soft and cooked, about 10-15 minutes, depending on size. Reserve about 1/2 cup of the mushrooms for garnish (chop them finely if coarse).
10. Add the rest of the mushrooms, garlic, broth, cashews, lemon juice, parsley, sea salt and black pepper, to taste, in 2 batches, in a high speed blender. Blend on high until smooth, about 1 minute.
11. Transfer back to the pot and bring to a low boil. Turn off the heat.
12. Serve immediately topped with the reserved mushrooms.
