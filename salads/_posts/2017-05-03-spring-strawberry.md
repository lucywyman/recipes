#### Directions:

1. Toss together all of the salad ingredients. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
2. In a small mason jar combine honey, mustard, salt and pepper,
vinegar, olive oil, and tarragon. Place a lid on the mason jar and
shake vigorously. Drizzle over the salad. Toss with more feta and
pistachios if you'd like and enjoy!
