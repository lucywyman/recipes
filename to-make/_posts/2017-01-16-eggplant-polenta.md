#### Directions:

##### To make the polenta
1. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring water and milk (or more water or broth) to a simmer.
2. Add the salt and slowly whisk in the polenta. Lower the heat to medium-low and bring mixture to a simmer. 
3. Stir in the butter and allow the polenta to simmer and thicken for 30 minutes. 
4. Once the polenta has thickened, add fresh cracked black pepper, remove from heat, cover, and allow to rest while you make the eggplant.
5. When ready to serve, remove the lid and whisk the polenta well before spooning into bowls.

##### To make the eggplant 
1. Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat oven to 375° F. Place a baking rack over a half-sheet baking tray and set aside.
2. Wash the outside of the eggplant and slice into ½-inch thick slices.
3. Set out three medium bowls. In one bowl whisk together flour with two big pinches of salt and pepper. 
4. In another bowl place eggs and beat well. In the final bowl place bread crumbs, oregano, parmesan, and a few good pinches of salt and pepper.
5. First dip an eggplant slice into the flour mixture, lightly coating both sides.
6. Next dip into the beaten egg, lightly coating on both sides.
7. Finally dip the eggplant in the panko mixture, coating both sides, and pressing lightly with your fingers to evenly coat the eggplant
slices. Place on the wire rack. 
8. Dip all of the eggplant slices, placing on the wire rack to bake.
9. Drizzle lightly with olive oil. Place in the oven to bake until golden brown and cooked through, about 18-22 minutes.
10. While the eggplant bakes, place diced tomatoes and butter in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat until warmed. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed.
11. To serve, in a medium serving bowl spoon warm polenta. Top with crisp eggplant slices and warm tomato sauce. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese and fresh torn basil. Enjoy!
