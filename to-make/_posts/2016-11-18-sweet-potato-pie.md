##### Directions:

###### To make the pie crust
1. In a medium bowl whisk together flour, sugar, and salt. 
2. Add cold, cubed butter and, using your fingers (or a potato
masher), work the butter into the flour mixture. 
3. Quickly break the butter down into the flour mixture, some butter
pieces will be the size of oat flakes, some will be the size of peas. 
4. Create a well in the mixture and pour in the cold buttermilk. 
5. Use a fork to bring to dough together. Try to moisten all of the
flour bits. Add a bit more buttermilk if necessary, but you want to
mixture to be shaggy and not outwardly wet.
6. On a lightly floured work surface, dump out the dough mixture. It
will be moist and shaggy. That’s perfect. 
7. Gently knead into a disk.
8. Wrap the disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Allowing
the dough to rest in the refrigerator will help rechill the butter and
distribute the moisture.
9. To roll out the pie crust, on a well floured surface, roll the
crust 1/8 inch thick and about 12 inches in diameter. 
10. Transfer it to a pie pan. Trim the edge almost even with the edge
of the pan Fold the edges under and crimp with your fingers or a fork.
11. Cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for a minimum of 30
minutes and a maximum of 3 hours.

###### To make the filling
1. Preheat the oven to 375° F. Place a rack in the upper third of
the oven.
2. First peel the sweet potatoes. Dice the sweet potatoes into large, 3-inch chunks. 
3. Place potato pieces in a large pot and cover with cool water. Place over medium high heat and bring
to a boil. 
4. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until the potatoes are tender throughout, about 20 minutes. Test the doneness of the
potatoes using a thin knife. If the knife meets any resistance, simmer the potatoes a bit longer.
5. Drain into a colander.
6. If you have a blender available, place cooked potato pieces, the packed brown
sugar, all of the spices, salt, butter, and half of the evaporated
milk in it and blend. 
7. If not, place ingredients in the same pot and either use and immersion blender, potato masher, or fork to mash the potatoes as they cook.
8. Cook on low flame, simmer for about 5 minutes. 
9. In a medium bowl, whisk together the remaining evaporated milk,
granulated sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract. Whisk well. 
10. Pour the egg mixture into the warm sweet potato mixture.
11. Pour the prepared filling into the pie crust. 
12. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes at 375° F. 
13. Reduce the heat to 325° F and cook until cooked through, about 45 to 50 minutes.
14. To test the pie for doneness lightly shake the baking sheet. If the
center of the pie has a wavy jiggle it needs more time in the oven.
If the center of the pie has a lighter, more structured jiggle, it’s
done!
