#### Directions:

1. In a small bowl combine the ½ cup of whole milk and the ½ cup
of heavy cream. Set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together egg yolks, sugar, and nutmeg until well combined and thickened slightly.
3. In a medium saucepan, heat remaining milk and cream over medium heat until steaming.
4. While whisking the egg and sugar mixture, slowly drizzle the steaming milk mixture into the egg mixture, tempering the eggs. 
5. Whisk until well combined.
6. Add the milky egg mixture back to the saucepan and return to medium-low heat. Stirring often, whisk the mixture until is it slightly thickened and reaches about 175° F. Do not overheat the mixture or it will curdle.
7. Remove from heat and immediately stir in the milk and cream mixture
you set aside earlier. If you'd like, strain through a fine mesh strainer.
8. Stir in ½ to 1 cup of spiced rum and pure vanilla extract.
9. Chill thoroughly (about 6 hours) and serve very chilled with fresh nutmeg sprinkled on top.
10. Eggnog will last up to 5 days in the refrigerator.
