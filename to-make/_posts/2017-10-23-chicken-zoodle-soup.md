##### Ingredients:

* 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breast
* 2 cloves garlic, smashed
* 1 bay leaf
* 11/2 quarts (6 cups) chicken broth
* 2 medium zucchini, spiralized into thick spirals, then cut into 2-inch pieces
* 1 medium carrot, peeled and spiralized into thin spirals, then cut into 2-inch pieces
* 1/4 medium onion, thinly sliced
* Optional toppings: freshly ground black pepper, lemon wedges, fresh thyme or parsley leaves

##### Directions:

1. Place the chicken breasts in a single layer on the bottom of a 3- to 4-quart Dutch oven or saucepan. 
2. Add the garlic, bay leaf, and salt. Pour in the chicken broth and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. 
3. Once boiling, use a spoon or small fine-mesh strainer to skim off any white foam that appears. 
4. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 165Â°F, 8 to 12 minutes.
5. Transfer the chicken to a clean cutting board. Discard the garlic cloves and bay leaf. 
6. Once cool enough to handle, shred the chicken with 2 forks or cut into bite-sized pieces.
7. Place the saucepan with the broth back over medium-high heat and bring back to a simmer. 
8. Add the zucchini, carrot, and onion, and simmer until tender, about 3 minutes. Return the chicken to the saucepan and stir to combine. 

Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with black pepper, lemon wedges, and fresh herbs as desired.
