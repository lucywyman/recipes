##### Ingredients:

* ⅓ cup granulated sugar
* 1 tablespoonspoon dried lavender
* 2½ teaspoons baking powder
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* ¾ teaspoon salt
* ¾ cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes

##### Directions:

1. Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat oven to 400°F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. In a mixing bowl sift together flour, sugar, lavender, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. 
3. Cut in butter (using your fingers or a pastry cutter) until mixture resembles a coarse meal.  Work the butter into the dry ingredients until some of the butter flakes are the size of peas and some are the size of oat flakes.    
4. In another bowl, combine egg and buttermilk and beat lightly with a fork.  
5. Add to flour mixture all at once, stirring enough to make a soft dough.  
6. Gently fold in the blackberries.
7. Turn out onto a floured board and gently knead about 15 times. 
8. Roll or pat out into a 1-inch thickness.  
9. Cut into 2-inch rounds using a round cutter or cut into 2×2-inch squares. Reshape and roll dough to create more scones with excess scraps. 
10. Place on an ungreased baking sheet.
11. Brush lightly with beaten egg and sprinkle with granulated sugar.
12. Bake for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown on top.  Serve warm.

Scones are best the day they’re made, and though they can be frozen
and lightly reheated in the oven if you need a future treat.
