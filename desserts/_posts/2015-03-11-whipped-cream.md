title: Homemade Whipped Cream
from: Our Kitchen
time: 5 minutes
---

Ingredients:
------------

* 1 cup Heavy cream (will provide about tripple the volume in whipped cream)
* Optional: vanilla (or other flavors!)
* Optional: Pinch of white sugar

<br>

Directions:
-----------

1. Place inredients in a bowl big enough that whipping the cream won't overflow
2. Mix the ingredients on medium speed (I usually do 3 on our 5-speed mixer) for 3-4 minutes. Sometimes it takes longer than that -- be patient!  Whipped cream is ready when stiff peaks start to form.
