#### Directions:

1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat oven to 375°F.
2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. When boiling, add the
brussels sprouts and simmer for 7 minutes, until they just begin to
tenderize. Drain into a colander, cover with ice and rinse with cool
water to stop the cooking process. Allow to rest while you assemble
the rest of the ingredients.
In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in the
flour, and whisk until the mixture is combined and starts to bubble
slightly. Don’t let the mixture brown too much, but it’s ok if it
browns a bit.
Whisk in the spices and then slowly stream the milk into the butter
and flour mixture, whisking as you stir. Whisk nearly constantly and
as the milk comes to a light simmer it will begin to thicken slightly.
Add a good pinch of both salt and pepper.
Lower heat to low.
In a small skillet heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onions and
whole garlic cloves and saute until the onions are transluscent and
beginning to brown and the cloves are browned.
In a small bowl toss together smoked gouda cheese and cornstarch. Add
the cheese to the thickening milk mixture and stir to combine. The
cheese will begin to melt and the cornstarch will further thicken the
sauce as it begins to simmer.
Stir in the cooked onions and garlic.
Cook until mixture is silky smooth and thickened.
Melt remaining 1 tablespoon of butter in the medium skillet. Add the
breadcrumbs and parsley and toss until coated in butter and browned
slightly, about 4 minutes. Add a good pinch of salt and fresh cracked
black pepper and place in a small bowl until it’s time to layer
everything.
Transfer drained brussels sprouts to a 2-quart baking disk. Add the
aged gouda and toss to combine.
Pour the smoked Gruyere cheese sauce over the vegetable mixture.
Bake, uncovered, until bubbling and golden brown and the brussels
sprouts are completely tender, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven
and top generously with breadcrumbs
Brussels sprouts can be made ahead of time by blanching the
vegetables, making the cheese sauce, assembling it all (except for the
bread crumbs!) in the baking dish, covered and refrigerated. Before
ready to serve, remove the cover from the dish, add the sauted bread
crumbs and bake as usual. Enjoy!
