#### Ingredients:

* 1 package Cappello's Fettuccine
* 1 pound scallops
* 2 garlic cloves, minced

* zest of 1 lemon

* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* Â½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
* pinch of black pepper
* small handful basil, roughly chopped

<br>

#### Directions:

1. Cook Cappello's fettuccine according to package instructions and
set aside. (You will reheat these in a pan later on)
2. Pat scallops down with a paper towel until completely dry. Sprinkle
with a bit of salt on both sides. 
3. Cook scallops on both sides for about 2 minutes per side, until scallops are browned and bounce
back when you press on them. 
4. Remove from pan and set aside once they are done cooking and cover with foil to keep warm.
5. Add garlic and shallot to the pan and cook for about 1-2 minutes,
until the shallot becomes translucent. 
6. Add lemon zest, lemon juice, olive oil and red pepper flakes. Use a wooden spoon to scrape
the bottom of the pan to remove any of the left behind from the scallops. 
7. Let mixture reduce for about 1 minute. Add fettuccine noodles to the pan and toss to coat and warm through. Then
add scallops back to the pan, add black pepper and basil and toss everything to coat.
8. Serve once warmed through!
