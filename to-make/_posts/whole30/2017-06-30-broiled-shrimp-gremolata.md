##### Directions:

1. Preheat the broiler to high and line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil (or don't, if you're lazy like me).
2. Rinse the shrimp and pat them dry with paper
3. Use a sharp knife to split the shrimp horizontally, cutting almost through to the opposite side but leaving the shrimp halves attached (I think this is called butterflying?)
4. Open the shrimp so they lay flat.
5. Arrange the shrimp flat side down on the baking sheet, and brush with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper
6. In a small bowl, combine the pine nuts, garlic, lemon zest, and 1 tablespoonspoon olive oil
7. Broil the shrimp, 4-5 inches from the heat, until almost opaque (4-5 minutes for jumbo shrimp, 2-3 minutes for medium shrimp)
8. Carefully flip each shrimp.
9. Spoon the pine nut mixture evenly on the shrimp, broil for 1 minute more.
10. To serve, divide the shrimp between 2 serving plates.
