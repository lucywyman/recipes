##### Directions:

###### For the Doughnuts
1. Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat oven to 350°F.  Lightly grease a doughnut pan and set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, spices, and brown sugar.  Set aside.
3. In a small saucepan over medium-low heat melt all of the butter (including the butter needed for the glaze).  Butter will begin to crackle and pop as it melts.  That’s the water melting out of the butter.  Once the water has evaporated the butter will quiet down and begin to brown.  Keep an eye on it, it browns quickly.  The butter will begin to smell nutty.  Remove from heat and immediately transfer browned butter (brown bits and all) to a small bowl.
4. In a small bowl whisk together egg, buttermilk, and vanilla extract.  
5. Measure out 2 tablespoonspoons of browned butter and whisk into the wet ingredients.
6. Add the wet ingredients all at once to the dry ingredients.  
7. Add the grated apple. Stir together until no flour bits remain and all of the ingredients are well combined.  Try not to overmix the batter.  That might create rubbery doughnuts.
8. Use a small spoon to dollop batter into the prepared pan.  Smooth out and fill each doughnut in the pan three-quarters full with batter.
9. Place in the oven and bake for 8 to 10 minutes.  Keep an eye on them and try not to over-bake them.  
10. Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the pan before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely.


###### For the Glaze

1. In a medium bowl whisk together the powdered sugar and salt.  
2. Add 2 tablespoonspoons of browned butter, vanilla extract, and 2 tablespoonspoons milk.  Whisk to combine.  Add more milk to make the glaze more spreadable.


Once the doughnuts are completely cool, use a butter knife to spread each doughnut with glaze.  Allow to rest for 15 minutes in the fridge to harden the glaze.  These doughnuts are best serve the day they’re made.
