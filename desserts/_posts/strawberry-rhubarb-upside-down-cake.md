#### Ingredients:

##### For the Topping

2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 cup sliced strawberries

##### For the Cake

1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
2/3 cup brown sugar
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
2/3 cup sour cream

<br>

#### Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
2. I used an 8-inch round with 3-inch tall sides. You can also use a 9-inch round with 2-inch sides.
3. Place butter in the cake pan and place in the oven. When butter is melted, remove pan from the oven.
4. Using two pot holders, tilt the pan around and around, coating the sides of the pan with butter. Once sides are coated, set aside.
5. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cardamom. Set aside.
6. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment cream butter and brown sugar on medium speed. Cream until slightly pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
7. Stop mixer, scrape down the bowl with a spatula, and add egg and vanilla extract. Beat for 1 minute.
8. Turn the mixer off, scrape the bowl, and add the dry ingredients.
9. Beat on low speed while adding the sour cream. Beat until the batter just comes together. Batter will be pretty thick.
10. Remove the bowl from the mixer and finish incorporating ingredients with a spatula.
11. Sprinkle 1/4 cup brown sugar into the melted butter in the cake pan.
12. Sprinkle strawberry slices and rhubarb over the butter and sugar in a single layer.
13. Spoon batter over the strawberries and spread evenly with a spatula.
14. Bake for about 35 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.
15. Let cake rest for 10 minutes before running a knife around the edge of the cake and inverting the cake onto a cake plate.

Serve warm with sweetened sour cream or whipped cream.
