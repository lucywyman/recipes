##### Ingredients:

* ¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons gluten-free multi-purpose flour (I used King Arthur Flour Blend)
* ¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons superfine sugar
* 2 tablespoons cornstarch
* 6 large egg whites
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* ¾ teaspoon cream of tartar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* ¼ cup plus 3 tablespoons superfine sugar (yes, more sugar)

##### Directions:

1. Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two cupcakes pans with paper liners and set aside.
2. In a small bowl whisk together and then sift the flour, cornstarch, and ¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar. Set aside.
3. In a large, clean (grease-free) mixing bowl, beat together on medium speed the egg whites, salt, and cream of tartar until foamy, about 4 minutes.
Add the vanilla extract. Gradually increase the speed of the mixer and continue beating until the egg whites have increased in volume, and thickened but are still bubbly.
4. Gradually beat in the remaining ¼ cup + 3 tablespoons sugar, a bit at a time, until the meringue holds soft peaks. This means that the egg white mixture will begin to hold the lines of the beater.
5. Stop the mixer and use a spatula to gently fold in the sifted flour/sugar blend a few tablespoons at a time, just until incorporated.
6. Spoon the batter into the prepared cupcakes pans until about ¾ full. Tap the pan on the counter to remove any big air bubbles.
7. Bake until the cupcakes are a deep golden brown, and the top springs back when pressed lightly, about 18 minutes.
8. Allow to cool completely. Top with whipped cream and strawberries, and enjoy!
