#### Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 325° F.

mixer. Beat on low speed with the paddle until well mixed.

8. Remove the bowl from the mixer and give the dough a few good turns with your spatula to bring it all together.
9. Arrange rounded teaspoons of the dough on a pan lined with parchment
paper. Space the balls about 2-inches apart and press on them lightly
to flatten slightly. 
10. Bake the cookies until they spread and become golden, about 20 minute
11. Remove the cookies and place on rack to cool ~10-15 minutes.

Enjoy!
