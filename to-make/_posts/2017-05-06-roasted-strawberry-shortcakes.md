#### Directions:

##### To make the cream
1. In a small saucepan heat the cream over medium heat to just
simmering. 
2. Remove from heat, lightly tear the basil leaves into the heated cream. 
3. Stir, cover, and allow to steep for 15 minutes. Remove the basil leaves, cover the cream, and chill in the refrigerator until chilled through, at least 1 hour.
4. When the cream is chilled, pour into a large bowl. 
5. Add powdered sugar, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Beat with a pair of electric hand beaters until just firm. Keep cool until ready to serve.

##### To make the strawberries
1. Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat oven to
375°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil so that the foil extends over the sides to catch any juices that accumulate during baking. 
2. Place sliced strawberries on the baking sheet. 
3. Add strawberries, salt, and vinegar and toss to coat. 
4. Place in the oven and roasted until softened through and bubbling,
about 15 to 20 minutes, tossing once during baking. 
5. Remove from the over and allow to cool.

##### To make the biscuits
1. Increase the oven temperature to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. In a mixing bowl, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder,
baking soda, and salt. 
3. Using your fingers, quickly work the butter
into the dry ingredients until some bits of butter are the size of oat
flakes, some the size of small peas. Chunks of cold butter is what we
want in our dough.
4. In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, combine egg yolk and
buttermilk and beat lightly with a fork.
5. Create a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the egg
mixture all at once. Stir into a shaggy mixture. The dough will be
moist, but not overly wet.
6. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board and use a floured
rolling pin to roll the dough to a ¾-inch thickness. Use a 2-inch
round biscuit cutter to cut biscuit, re-rolling and pressing the dough
to cut 6 biscuits total.
7. Place 1-inch apart on the prepared baking sheet and brush lightly
with buttermilk.
8. Bake for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown on top.
9. Allow to cool to a warm room temperature. Slice in half. Top with
strawberries and cream, a small fresh basil leaf and the top biscuit.
