##### Ingredients:

* 1 cup rolled oats
* 6 tablespoons (60g) hemp hearts
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* ½ teaspoon cinnamon, plus more for sprinkling
* ¼ teaspoon sea salt
* 2 large eggs
* ½ cup plain, unsweetened Greek yogurt
* ⅓ cup almond milk or water, plus more if needed for thinning batter
* 1 tablespoon sugar, optional
* ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

##### Directions:

Preheat an electric or stovetop griddle.
While griddle is preheating, place all of the pancake ingredients
into a blender jar in the order listed. Pulse a few times, then blend
until smooth. Add a little more almond milk or water, if needed. The
batter should be pourable, but not too thick or too thin.
Lightly grease the preheated griddle with butter or oil, if
needed. (I use one that doesn't require greasing first.) Using about 2
tablespoons of better per pancake, pour batter onto the hot griddle.
Let cook for 1-2 minutes on the first side, then flip and cook for
another few minutes until cooked through. Transfer to a plate and keep
warm until ready to serve.
Repeat process with remaining batter, being sure to grease griddle
well between each batch to prevent sticking.
To serve, divide the pancakes between two plates. Spread each
pancake with a little almond butter and top with fruit. Sprinkle with
cinnamon and a few more hemp hearts, if desired. Serve warm.
