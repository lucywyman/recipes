##### Ingredients:

* 1 15-ounce (425 g) cans pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)
* ¼ cup (60 ml) maple syrup (Grade A is best)
* 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
* ½ tsp ground cinnamon
* pinch sea salt

##### Directions:

###### In the Microwave:

The minimalist baker version calls for about 20 minutes on the stove, but I usually end up just microwaving it for about 5. It still gets rid of the squashy flavor, though the texture isn't quite the same!

1. Add all ingredients to a microwave safe bowl and stir thoroughly
2. Microwaving for 2-3 minutes, stopping to stir every minute
3. Enjoy!

###### The Minimalist Baker Way

1. Add all ingredients to a large saucepan or pot over medium-high heat and stir to combine.
2. Once it begins bubbling, reduce heat to low and simmer. You’re looking for a frequent bubble, so if there isn’t much going on at the surface, increase heat to medium-low heat. If bubbling too vigorously, reduce heat to low.
3. Cook, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. This is 20-minute pumpkin butter, but if you have more time, leaving it on the stove for another 5-10 minutes will only deepen the flavors and thicken the texture. However, 20 minutes was about perfect!
4. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more coconut sugar or maple syrup for sweetness, lemon juice for acidity, cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice for warmth, or salt to balance the flavors.
5. Once cooled completely, transfer to a large glass container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, sometimes more (depending on the freshness of your ingredients).
6. Pumpkin butter is a delicious addition to fall goodies like waffles, pancakes, pumpkin bread, butternut squash banana bread, or oatmeal! Enjoy straight from the fridge, or let it warm to room temperature before adding to items like waffles or pancakes.
