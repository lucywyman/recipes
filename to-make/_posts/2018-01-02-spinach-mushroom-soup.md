##### Ingredients:

*  6 tablespoons unsalted butter or extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 ¼ pounds mixed mushrooms (such as cremini, oyster, chanterelles and shiitake), chopped
* ½ pound shallots, finely diced

##### Directions:

1. Heat 3 tablespoons butter or oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. 
2. Add half the mushrooms and half the shallots; cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the mushrooms are well browned, 10 to 12 minutes. 
3. Transfer mushrooms to a bowl and repeat with remaining butter, mushrooms and shallots.
4. Return all mushrooms to the pot and stir in tomato paste, thyme, cinnamon and allspice; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
5. Stir in 5 cups water, the salt and the black pepper. 
6. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium heat and cook gently for 20 minutes. 
7. Stir in baby spinach and let cook until just wilted, 1 to 2 minutes.
8. Using an immersion blender or food processor, coarsely purée soup. Thin with water, as needed. Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary. 

Serve with dollops of yogurt if you'd like.
