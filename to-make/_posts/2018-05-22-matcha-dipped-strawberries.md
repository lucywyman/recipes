##### Ingredients:

* 2 oz. white chocolate, chopped
* ¼ cup virgin coconut oil, melted
* 1 tsp. matcha
* Pinch of kosher salt
* 20 chilled large stem-on strawberries, patted dry

##### Directions:

1. Stir white chocolate, oil, matcha, and salt in a medium heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (don’t let bowl touch water) until nearly smooth. 
2. Remove from heat; stir until chocolate is melted. 
3. Set into a larger bowl of ice water and chill, stirring constantly, until thickened and just starting to lose its sheen, about 2 minutes.
4. Working one at a time, hold berries by stems and dip into matcha mixture to coat; let excess drip back into bowl. 
5. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and optionally sprinkle with sesame seeds. (Depending on their size, you will be able to coat 15–20 berries.) 
6. Reheat matcha mixture if it starts to set before you have dipped all the berries. 
7. Chill dipped berries until shell is set, 20–25 minutes.

Enjoy! These are, of course, amazing with whipped cream
