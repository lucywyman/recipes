#### Directions:

1. Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat oven to 375°F.
2. To make the biscuits, in a medium bowl whisk together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar. 
3. Add 7 tablespoons of the cold butter chunks to the dry ingredients and use your fingers or a pastry cutter to work the butter into the flour
mixture. 
4. Work the butter into the mixture until some butter is the size of oat flakes, some the size of small peas, and all of the dry ingredients are lightly coated in fat.
5. Create a small well in the center of the mixture and add the buttermilk. Use a fork to fluff the mixture together, being sure to moisten every bit with buttermilk. Add a tablespoon or two more if your mixture is feeling too dry.
6. Stir the mixture into a shaggy dough then dump onto a lightly floured work surface.
7. Gently work the dough into a 2-inch thick disk.
8. Use a lightly floured rolling pin to roll the dough to a 1-inch thickness. Use a 2 ½ inch round biscuit cutter to cut biscuit rounds, gathering and rerolling the scraps to cut 9 biscuits. Set aside.
9. In a 9-inch square pan, toss together rhubarb and strawberry pieces, sugar, cornstarch, salt, nutmeg, orange zest and orange juice.
10. Toss until everything is evenly coated.
11. Bake fruit mixture for 20 minutes, until just beginning to bubble.
12. Remove from the oven and place the biscuits on top of the warmed fruit. Brush the top of the biscuits with the remaining tablespoon of butter that has been melted.
13. Return the biscuits and fruit to the oven and bake for 15 minutes, until the fruit has broken down and bubbled, and the biscuits are risen and golden.
14. While the biscuits bake, combine cream, honey, vanilla, and salt in a medium bowl. Beat with an electric hand mixer until the cream reaches soft peaks.
15. Remove the cobbler from the oven, allow to cool for 20 to 30 minutes before serving so it’s just warm when dishing into bowls.
16. Serve with honeyed cream and enjoy!
