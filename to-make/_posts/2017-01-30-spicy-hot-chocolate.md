##### Directions:

1. In a medium pot (saucepan?), heat the milk over medium heat for 5-10 minutes, until it's hot to the touch and just on the verge of boiling
2. Combine the hot milk and other ingredients in a blender on low speed for 1-2 minutes, allowing the milk to froth a bit.
3. Optional top with whipped cream, cinnamon, or more chocolate!
