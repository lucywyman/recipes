##### Ingredients:

* Unbaked tart crust in a 9-inch fluted pan ([see recipe here](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015673-tart-dough))
* 1¼ cups (125 grams) almond flour
* ½ cup (68 grams) all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* Pinch of fine sea salt
* 1 stick (113 grams) unsalted butter, very soft
* ½ cup (100 grams) sugar
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature, lightly beaten
* ½ teaspoon almond extract
* 1 jar (340 to 370 grams) raspberry jam, to make 1 slightly rounded cup
* ⅓ cup sliced almonds (optional)

##### Directions:

###### To Bake Crust:
1. Center a rack in the oven, and preheat it to 400°F. 
2. Prick the crust all over with a fork, cover with buttered foil and fill with dried rice or beans. 
3. Place on a baking sheet, and bake for 15 minutes. 
4. Remove the foil and weights, and bake for 3 minutes more, until lightly colored. Set aside to cool.

###### To Make Filling:

1. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F. 
2. Whisk the almond flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder and sea salt together. 
3. Working with a mixer, beat the butter and sugar together on medium speed for 3 minutes, until pale and creamy. 
4. Gradually beat in the eggs, scraping the bowl as needed. The mixture may curdle — it’s O.K. 
5. Beat in the almond extract. 
6. Reduce the mixer speed to low, and add half of the dry mixture. 
7. When incorporated, add the rest, and beat only until it disappears into the batter. Finish blending with a spatula.
8. Spread the jam in the crust, and top with the filling, covering the jam as completely as you can. (The filling doesn’t spread easily, but imperfections work out in the end.) If you’d like, sprinkle with sliced almonds.
9. Bake the tart for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the top feels firm and is puffed all the way to the center. (Check the tart after about 25 minutes, and if it is browning quickly, tent it loosely with foil.) 

Transfer to a rack, and let it cool before icing, if you’d like, and serving.
To make the icing: Stir the sugar and ½ tablespoon water together. If the icing doesn’t run off the spoon slowly and steadily, add more water drop by drop. Drizzle over the tart, and let it dry at room temperature.
