###### For the dressing:

##### Directions:

1. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 400Â°F.
2. Place the broccoli florets and unpeeled garlic cloves on the same baking sheet. 
3. Drizzle with half the oil, toss to combine, and spread into an even layer. 
4. Roast until the broccoli is just starting to turn golden-brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Season with salt and set aside.
5. Make the dressing: Squeeze out the garlic from their skins into a high-powered blender. 
6. Drain the water from the cashews and add to the blender. 
7. Add the broth or water, oil, and lemon juice. 
8. Blend on high speed until very smooth (if it is too thick, blend in a few more splashes of water). Taste and season well with salt and pepper; set aside.
9. Assemble the salad: Place the kale, remaining 1/2 tablespoon of oil, and a big pinch of salt in a large bowl. 
10. Massage with your hands to soften the leaves, then let sit for 5 minutes. 
11. Add the roasted broccoli, cannellini beans, and parsley and toss to combine. 
12. Add the dressing and toss to combine. Sprinkle with the sunflower seeds.
