#### Directions:

1. Follow [initialization docs](http://recipes.lucywyman.me/initialization.html)
to create the jekyll site.
2. Install Sass by running ``gem install sass``, then compile Sass to CSS by
running ``sass in.scss out.css``.  All valid CSS is also valid Sass, so if
you're still learning it, you can just write CSS and then incrementally Sass-ify
it.  Learn more about what Sass can do [here](http://slides.lucywyman.me/sass.html),
or check out [their awesome documentation](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html).
3. MaterializeCSS gives you several nice features in line with Google Material
design. They have a color palette, font, buttons, and other features that 
make designing your website that much easier. I'd recommend reading their 
documentation to see what you'd find most useful.  Using Materialize is 
as simple as downloading their files, and including them in your assets
directory. I copied the parts I needed -- ``materialize.scss``, ``components/``,
and ``fonts`` into their respective directories in ``assets/``, then deleted
the rest of the Materialize package, but it's up to you what you want to
include!
4. Simple Jekyll Search gives you a way to index your site, then search it 
all clientside and send that data to a specific ``<ul>`` element. I ran 
into a few problems when I tried to add full text search, so would recommend 
not doing that! I also add some javascript below to toggle having a Search 
Results header when the results list is displayed.

```javascript
    $("#search-input").keyup(function(){
        if($("#search-input").val() != ""){
            $("#results").css("display", "block"); 
        } else {
            $("#results").css("display", "none"); 
        }
    });
```

``#search-input``is the id of the search bar in my site, while ``#results``
is the id of the results header that I want to either display or not display.
The items in the results list will automatically display as the user starts
typing into the search bar and the results list, living in 
``<ul id="results-container">`` is populated. 
5. Slicknav is what I use for the mobile menu. I'm not really sure what else 
to say, besides that I highly recommend it as it's very simple to use
and highly configurable.
