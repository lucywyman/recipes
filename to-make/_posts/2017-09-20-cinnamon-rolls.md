##### Directions:
        
###### To make the dough

1. Place all of the dough ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, and gently mix together with a spatula before fitting the bowl into the mixer.
2. Mix on low until the dough begins to come together. The dough will come together into a soft, though not too sticky dough ball after several minutes of hand mixing and stand mixer mixing.
3. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and lightly dust the top of the dough with flour. The flour will help you see that the dough is rising. 
4. Let it rise until it's almost double in size, about 2 hours.

###### To make the filling

1. Combine the nuts in one bowl, and the butter, brown sugar, and ground cinnamon in another. Set aside.

###### Assembling

1. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough into a 14 x 12 inch rectangle. 
2. Spread the softened cream cheese evenly over the surface and fold the bottom and top edges of the dough over 1 inch.
3. Fold one short end into the center. Fold the other short end over the first, like you were folding a letter.
4. Carefully roll the dough into a 14 x 12 inch rectangle again, being careful not to tear the dough and reveal the cream cheese. Fold it like a letter again.
5. Finally, roll the dough into a 12 x 18 inch rectangle. If some cream cheese starts to come through the dough, just flour the dough slightly and keep moving along. 
6. Spread the cinnamon filling evenly over the dough, followed by the nuts.
7. Beginning with one long edge, roll the dough into a log. 
8. Cut the log into 8 or 9 equal slices. 
9. Place the slices in a greased 9 inch square or 10 inch square baking pan, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise for 1 hour more. 
10. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 375°F.
11. Bake the rolls for 30 to 35 minutes, until they're golden brown. Remove the rolls from the oven.

###### To ice

1. Whisk together the remaining cream cheese and sugar. Add the milk and whisk. Drizzle icing over the warm buns, and enjoy!

**Notes**: To make the rolls the night before follow the recipe through
slicing the rolls and placing them in the greased baking dish. Instead of
leaving them out to rise, cover with plastic and place the rolls in the
refrigerator to slowly rise overnight. When you want to bake them the next
day, allow them to come to room temperature on the kitchen counter for about
30 minutes, preheat the oven and bake according to the recipe.
