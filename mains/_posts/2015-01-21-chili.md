##### Directions

1. Toss olive oil, onions, and garlic into a sauce pan and sautee until onions are translucent.
2. In a large pot (I actually use a wok) combine all ingredients over medium heat (4 or 5 on most stoves), stirring frequently.  
3. After about ten minutes, turn heat down to 3 and let simmer until everyone is ready to eat!
