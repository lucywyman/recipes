##### Ingredients:

* 6 ounces unsalted butter, melted and browned to just over 1/2 cup of butter
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
* 2 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 1/4 cup buttermilk
* 1 1/4 cup mashed banana (from about 3 medium bananas)
* 2 teaspoons molasses

##### Directions:

1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350°F. Grease and flour a 9×5-inch loaf pan and set aside.
2. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Butter will begin to foam and crackle as it melts. 
3. When the crackling subsides, the butter will begin to brown. Swirl the pan as the butter cooks. 
4. When the butter browns and begins to smell nutty, remove the pan from the flame and transfer the butter to a small bowl. Taking the butter out of the hot saucepan will stop the butter from overcooking and burning. Set aside to cool.
5. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
6. In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, vanilla extract, and buttermilk. 
7. Whisk in the mashed bananas and molasses. 
8. When butter has cooled, whisk in the browned butter.
9. Add the wet ingredients, all at once to the dry ingredients. 
10. Fold together, making sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl to reveal any hidden pockets of flour. Fold together ingredients, but try not to over stir.
11. Spoon batter into prepared pan.  
12. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until a skewer inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. 
13. Remove from the oven and allow to rest in the pan for 15 minutes, before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy this bread with butter, peanut butter, or just plain! Bread will last 4 days, well wrapped at room temperature. This loaf also freezes well.
