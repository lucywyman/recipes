##### Directions:

1. Combine pastry flour with the baking powder, cinnamon and salt.
2. Add the milk, egg, melted butter, vanilla and maple syrup. Give a good stir, until everything is just combined but there might few small lumps left. Let rest while heating the griddle or pan.
3. Heat a skillet or griddle over low to medium-low heat and grease with butter or oil if need be.
4. When skillet is hot (if you flick water onto the skillet, it should sizzle), take a scant Â¼ cup of batter and pour onto skillet.
5. Let cook for 1-2 minutes, until the pancakes begins to bubble slightly.
6. Flip and let cook for another 1-2 minutes until pancake is cooked through.
