title: Dates Wrapped in Bacon stuffed with Cheese
from: Our Kitchen
time: 30 minutes
---

#### Ingredients:

* Dates or Figs -- we buy them seedless, which makes them easy to cut
* Bacon
* Cream cheese or feta cheese or really any kind of cheese

<br>

#### Directions:

0. Preheat oven to 350*F
1. Fill dates with cheese of choice.  We generally do this by cutting them open, smearing cream cheese on them, the rolling them back up.
2. Cut bacon slices into thirds.
3. Wrap bacon around date and spear with a toothpick to keep it all together (if you don't have toothpicks, don't worry about it)
4. Place on baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until bacon is crispy.
