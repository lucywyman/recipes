##### Directions:

1. Chop broccoli and chicken into 1-inch cubes. Smaller is better!
2. Divide olive oil between two sauce pans.  Heat each about 2 minutes.
3. Add broccoli to one pan, in even layer, stirring to coat with olive oil.  Add salt, pepper, and minced garlic to taste (I do 1 tsp each).
4. Add chicken to other pan, similarly coating and seasoning. 
5. Stir broccoli and chicken occassionally. 
6. Bring a pot of ~4 quarts of water to boil (is your stovetop looking crowded yet?).  Add 1 tbsp salt
7. Pour in pasta, and boil for 8-10 minutes
8. Once broccoli and chicken are starting to turn golden-brown, remove from heat.
9. Drain pasta, and add broccoli and chicken to the pot.
10.
