##### Directions:

1. Get out a big soup pot -- the soup will start out voluminous because mushrooms have a lot of water, and will boil down
2. Heat the butter in the pot over medium-high heat. 
3. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until soft, 6-8 minutes.
4. Add the garlic and cook 1 more minute
5. Add the mushrooms, thyme, 2 teaspoons salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper, and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms shrink to half their size (~10 minutes).
6. Add the broth and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the mushrooms are tender and the soup thickens slightly, 15-20 minutes
7. Puree half of the soup (about 3 cups) in a blender or food processor until smooth, then stir back into the pot.
8. Thin with additional broth if needed, and season with salt and pepper.
