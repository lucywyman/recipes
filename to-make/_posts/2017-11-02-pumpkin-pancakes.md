##### Ingredients:

##### Dry mix:
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons light brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice

##### Wet mix:
* 1 cup buttermilk, shaken
* 1 large egg
* 1/4 cup pumpkin puree
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly

##### Directions:

1. In a medium bowl, mix together flours, brown sugar, baking powder,
baking soda, salt, and spice
2. In a measuring cup, measure out the buttermilk. Add the egg,
pumpkin puree, and melted butter; beat until thoroughly combined.
3. In one batch, add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and
mix until just combined. The batter should have some small to medium
lumps.
4. Heat up your griddle (or cast iron skillet) over medium heat and
brush with 1/2 tablespoon of butter. Scoop the batter, using a
tablespoon measure on to the warm skillet. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until
small bubbles form on the surface of the pancake, and then flip.
Repeat until youâ€™re done with all the batter. Serve with pats of
butter and warm maple syrup.
