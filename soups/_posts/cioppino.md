##### Ingredients:

* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 28 oz can diced tomatoes
* 1 cup diced onion
* 1 cup chopped carrots
* 1 cup water
* 1 cup broth
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 2 tablespoons minced garlic
* 2 teaspoons ground fennel

##### Directions:

1. Place oil, tomato, onions, carrots, water, broth, tomato paste, garlic, oregano, ground fennel seeds, salt and pepper into the inner liner of the Instant pot. Stir well. 
2. Set Instant Pot at High pressure for 15 minutes. When cook time is complete, let pot sit undisturbed for 10 minutes, and then release any remaining pressure. You can complete these steps and put the soup away in the refrigerator, to finish later. This really helps the flavors in the soup develop, but if you’re ready to eat, it’s not necessary.
3. Turn the pot to sauté and add fish, mussels, bay scallops, and calamari rings to the pot. Once the pot boils, add in the shrimp and cook until all the seafood is cooked through. Add lemon juice right before serving.
