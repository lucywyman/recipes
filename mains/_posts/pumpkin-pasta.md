##### Ingredients:

* 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling
* 1–14 ounce can pumpkin puree (or about 1 ⅔ cups homemade puree)
* 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon

<br>

##### Directions:

1. Pile the flour in the middle of a board or clean countertop.
2. Make a well in the center, and add in the pumpkin puree.
3. Using clean hands, mix together the puree and flour until it forms a stiff dough (adding more flour if needed to make it not sticky).
4. Divide the dough in half, covering one half with a towel to keep it from drying out. Form remaining dough half into a disc.
5. Flour a rolling pin and roll out the disc into a very thin sheet (you should almost be able to see through it in parts).
6. Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut into ¼″ long strips. Repeat with remaining dough disc.
7. Bring to a boil two quarts of salted water.
8. Drop noodles into the water a few at a time.
8. Cook for two minutes, or until all the noodles float. Drain and top with sauce.
