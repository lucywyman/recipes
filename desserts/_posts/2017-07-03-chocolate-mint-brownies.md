##### Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease an 8-inch x 8-inch pan or line with foil.
2. In a medium bowl, place the dates; pour in enough hot water to cover. Let sit for 10 minutes. Drain dates.
3. In the bowl of a food processor or blender, add dates, almond butter, applesauce, and non-dairy milk. Process until well combined, stopping to scrape down the sides.
4. Add oat flour, cocoa powder, 1½ teaspoons peppermint extract, baking soda, vanilla, and salt. Process until completely mixed.
5. Stir in ½ cup chocolate chips until all ingredients are combined.
6. Pour batter into the pan. Sprinkle with additional chocolate chips (optional)
7. Bake for 25-30 minutes. Let the bars cool in the pan for 10 minutes; place in fridge for faster cooling time.
8. Scoop out the solid white cream from the coconut milk; add to a medium bowl. 
9. Beat with an electric mixer or whisk until smooth. Add coconut sugar, spirulina powder, and ½ teaspoon peppermint extract. Beat until combined.
10. Scoop the coconut cream onto the brownies and spread evenly.
11. In a small bowl, add remaining ¼ cup chocolate chips. Warm in the microwave for 30 seconds, then stir; repeat until melted. Drizzle chocolate on top of the brownies.
12. Slice and serve!
